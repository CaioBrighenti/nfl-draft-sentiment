2020-04-06 23:35:33	Texans	Guess Tennessee likes to under utilize running backs.Foster had RBBC his senior year	84
2020-04-06 23:35:36	Redskins	Gotta be someone from a long time ago, so he could kick AND the quarterback position wasn't that important.Sammy Baugh, maybe?	126
2020-04-06 23:35:39	Giants	Blew his engine, had to go to the shop for some repairs	55
2020-04-06 23:35:45	Giants	Not exactly what you're looking for but the 2011 Giants had the worst point differential of any Super Bowl champion at -6. They're the only one with a negative Point differential.	179
2020-04-06 23:36:06	Seahawks	I have zero problem with Beast Quake or The Tip for Sherman. Those were definitely the top plays in each of their careers and came at the biggest moments.	154
2020-04-06 23:36:13		I liked it lol	14
2020-04-06 23:36:14	Steelers	That one time, the fight-or-flight response chose flight. Damn.	63
2020-04-06 23:36:18	Raiders	Nah just a bad wheel.	21
2020-04-06 23:36:25		Some of his hits were like linebacker hits... last true fullback. Niners fullback is more versatile but there hasn’t been a guy that could move people like Leach in a while.	173
2020-04-06 23:36:25	Patriots	hi yes I’ll take one jeudy please	33
2020-04-06 23:36:29	Bengals	Pancho Villa	12
2020-04-06 23:36:41	Patriots	And that’s a solid argument to make and the reason I was on the fence. Naming it DB and not CB/S isn’t supporting evidence of that though.	138
2020-04-06 23:36:48	Saints	Be funny	8
2020-04-06 23:36:48	Giants	How the hell is Russell Wilson not there I get Brady but Wilson most wins through seven seasons at 75 and a Superbowl champ 2 years after entering the league and one of TWO QBs to have a passer rating over 100 all time.	219
2020-04-06 23:36:51		Oh shit I forgot about that one. That may be a top 3-5 catch all time for me. Definitely would have been the play had they held on to win	137
2020-04-06 23:36:53	Lions	Gareon Conley potentially. Was #2 to Eli apple and marshon lattimore	68
2020-04-06 23:36:58	Eagles	1943. Ol Jack McWeiner led the 4-7-2 Milwaukee Sounders to the playoffs.	72
2020-04-06 23:36:58	49ers	And even the teams copying the old system usually tweak it some	63
2020-04-06 23:37:14	Giants	Both giants teams this century are among the least talented super bowl winnerEdit: especially 2011, that defense was not good	125
2020-04-06 23:37:16	Saints	We both know how saints fans are	32
2020-04-06 23:37:17	Patriots	Actual bands with real talent? Please qualify this statement with a few of your favorites. Literally shaking right now from this fuckin comment.	144
2020-04-06 23:37:19		Culture definitely changing for the better. It's funny but in my experience last year, selling beer made a noticeable difference in keeping seniors and juniors in their seats through the 4th quarter lol	202
2020-04-06 23:37:23	Seahawks	This argument is so tiresome. Sherman was almost always on an island on the right side of the field while Kam was either in the box or over the top and earl was helping the other corner. Thats the reason why our D was so elite. We had the best CB, best SS, and best FS all playing together in their primes. If anything Sherman helped Earl and Kam more than they helped him because they didn't ever have to worry about an entire side of the field.	446
2020-04-06 23:37:51	Packers	Does anyone still have the backup QB doing it or is it always a punter now	74
2020-04-06 23:37:51	Packers	This isn't really a video stuttering thing though, half of the quarter is just missing on gamepass. The issue was there when I first did this game and messed up the audio recording a week and a half ago. I sent some feedback to them and got a generic response. Maybe they'll get around to it eventually.	303
2020-04-06 23:38:03	Steelers	Jon and CGP are such perfectionists that it’ll take like 5 years to make.	73
2020-04-06 23:38:07	Patriots	bro it was the right call, what do you want them to do, ignore the rulebook when a player breaks the rules (even though it's a technicality) because it's a big play?	165
2020-04-06 23:38:28	Lions	Please ignore this guy before it's too late. He's been doing this "where's the money going" thing for weeks now in every pats trade then bringing up bill walsh lol	163
2020-04-06 23:38:36	Giants	LOL	3
2020-04-06 23:38:36	Seahawks	When you fly, you always wanna go higher and faster.	52
2020-04-06 23:38:39	Giants	Serious question, how the fuck would you even measure long snapper effectiveness? I feel like no one is tracking shitty snaps	125
2020-04-06 23:38:43	Seahawks	I've been mostly fine about drafting some guy early that no one's projected to go at that point but part of me just wants to go with the consensus pick for once.  I'd love to get YGM but Pete and John probably have someone else in mind, or they'll just trade down	263
2020-04-06 23:38:49	Packers	Why not 53, y’know, like a real fuckin roster?	46
2020-04-06 23:38:55	Lions	You dont understand after having it explained a hundred times?	62
2020-04-06 23:39:11	Chiefs	Meh career then went off in 2014 somehow then back to meh.	58
2020-04-06 23:39:12		People don't remember that he was the backup at the beginning of that season	76
2020-04-06 23:39:15		Gronk was more valuable and dominant than any tight end, I don’t think it’s fair to put anybody over him, it’s not like he had a short peak, he was head and shoulders above anybody at his position for 6-7 years.  It just comes down to how much you value longevity versus dominance.	281
2020-04-06 23:39:31	Redskins	37 fucking touchdowns. Lol. That was a wild season of college football.Barry Sanders in general was wild.	105
2020-04-06 23:39:31	Bears	Wow, 40k. That's staggering. Over here in Florida we're only at 13k plus and it feels like it's been popping up at random spots close by in the city. One day a store is open, the next it's had a covid worker and it's closed. I'm hoping the peak is on the horizon but I worry that's just wishful thinking at this point.	318
2020-04-06 23:39:35	Cowboys	Lol see I just get downvoted cause of my flair. Your runs were spectacular but doesn’t mean the teams were good	111
2020-04-06 23:39:49	Broncos	I feel like players usually don't blast the QB on these type of returns, assuming the QB won't really make an attempt to tackle the returner	140
2020-04-06 23:39:56	Vikings	Thing is that's not McCarthy being extra conservative. 999 of 1000 times any HC would do the exact same. The only time you see coaches go for 2 to finish the game at the NFL level are when they're awful teams in games that don't matter. Even with a great offense that's a low percentage play.	292
2020-04-06 23:40:00	Vikings	Where is the Gronk blocking someone into the camera on a TD run? That is my favorite play from him.	99
2020-04-06 23:40:00	Patriots	Madden does literally explain this concept in the video. I get dumping on refs for fucking up DPI calls or a lousy spot but what are the expected to do when this is a textbook example of the rule that Madden describes	217
2020-04-06 23:40:01	Giants	Great username lol	18
2020-04-06 23:40:02	Saints	The only threads that saints fans wont get downvoted for shitposting on the Falcons	83
2020-04-06 23:40:10		BUT ONLY SLIGHTLY LESS	22
2020-04-06 23:40:16	Falcons	As a Falcons fan, even with 28-3 happening, I’m not sure I believed I’d ever see them even in a Super Bowl. I think that many teams being down helped. We were 7-5 at one point, but then we had the Rams and 49ers back to back, and then we won two fairly easy divisional games to finish 11-5. Without that easy couple of weeks against the Rams and 49ers, we might not have been in a position to make a run. Goes to show how who you play and when you play them can actually make a difference.	489
2020-04-06 23:40:18	Raiders	No Dave casper?	15
2020-04-06 23:40:27	Ravens	[this one in the same thread is bonkers](https://twitter.com/ReceiverSchool/status/1247336887188144128?s=20)	108
2020-04-06 23:40:28	Bears	You’re a Packer fan, you’ve seen Mitch. You should know the answer to this question.	84
2020-04-06 23:40:40	Seahawks	This one and I wish they would have chosen Earl lighting up Gronkowski	70
2020-04-06 23:40:54		I agree haha I think that’s a solid addition to alumni. Tailgate scene before the game is always a blast too	108
2020-04-06 23:41:13		Shady has some of the sexiest 3yard runs you'll ever see lol. I'm not even talking shit, he's always been the most electrifying rb imo, albeit a biased opinion. He played like he was using the real life Madden juke moves from back in the day	241
2020-04-06 23:41:17		2021	4
2020-04-06 23:41:20	Patriots	Let me put it this way. 2011 Gronk got injured before the SB. They lost a close game because he could only be used as a decoy 2012 they were one of the best teams, injured right before the AFCCG and they lose at home (only home home playoff loss in an AFCCG the Pats had this decade 2013 out most of the season and it’s the Pats worse season of the decade 2014, healthy and they win a SB2015, mostly healthy all year, the one game he is out is a loss that causes them homefield. Against an all time great defense in the AFCCG Brady starts spamming Gronk and makes what would have been a comeback if not for a missed extra point because they can’t stop him 2016: they pay Bennett a fortune as Gronk insurance just in case. 2017. Gronk is healthy they are dominant, Brady wins MVP and they break passing records in the SB. Defense is the reason they lose despite and amazing performance 2018 Gronk is banged up beyond belief. He finally gets healthy by playoff time, team is totally different and runs through the playoffs. Gronk makes game changing SB play 2019 is the only other year this decade that Gronk is not there for most of besides 2013. Is considered the other worst Pats season this decade. Yes Gronk had health issues. SB’s however were however won and lost largely on his status and he was the biggest difference in success for the team. You could not say that about Gonzalez.	1388
2020-04-06 23:41:29	Jaguars	>The Chargers are taking Tyrod over him.You say that, but it could very well be (and seems likely) they plan to draft a QB. Tyrod has never been anything more than a bridge.>Dalton was pretty much worse than Trubisky last year and unless he gets the Belichick magic, he’s just Flacco 2.0.So was Foles, lol. The idea is that if you're willing to believe Foles will be better on a different team, so can Dalton. >Foles has a 2:1 QB/INT ratio in his career,Do you think that's because he's genuinely good or because he got the flukiest season of all time and every major stat predicted a massive regression (which came) and hasn't been very good since. [Here's an article from 2014 describing it.](http://thecomeback.com/thisgivensunday/2014-articles/was-nick-foles-2013-season-a-fluke.html)Even if it wasn't a fluke, his prowess since then has proven he cannot sustain that success with any degree of certainty, because his famous 2:1 ratio in every other year combined becomes 44:33, or 4:3. If that were truly him, why can't he maintain those stats? I know you're going to give me that bullshit about him being on a bunch of bad teams, but that doesn't explain his mediocrity in 2018 nor why guys like Case Keenum and Minshew are able to play much better on the worse or the same teams, respectively. The only answer I can seem to get is that Foles has a play style that requires him to have a **lot** of surrounding pieces, which is an elegant way of saying he fucking sucks. Case was decent in 2017 on that stacked Vikings team but you don't see people banging the drum for him to start anywhere. He also played much better with that awful Redskins team than Foles did here on a purely efficiency basis; higher TD%, higher ANY/A, higher Qb rating, lower sack %, with all the other efficiency stats being either close or functionally irrelevant (Foles had a higher cmp% by 1 point but they're both well above 60 so who gives a fuck). Don't even get me started on Minshew.So what does that mean? It means that a QB that is good selectively and only with a great team is what most people would call a very shitty quarterback, but because he got hot at the right time people will throw themselves in front of him as a meat shield despite him more than earning his reputation as a failure.>You know this thing will probably bleeds into OTA’s right? It’s not gonna be a lot of timeDidn't realize QB's had to be there physically to learn the playcalling. Don't say it's chemistry between the receivers, either, because Foles doesn't have that either; playing games with someone once doesn't mean shit as evidenced by how Foles accomplished nothing with Conley here but Minshew really lifted him up.	2693
2020-04-06 23:41:32	Vikings	Vikings long snapper lost half his pinky in 2018 and played the rest of the game. Badass needs respect	102
2020-04-06 23:41:33	Ravens	**Baker Mayfield**	18
2020-04-06 23:41:37		Gronk is the greatest postseason tight end ever honestly, he was just so dominant in every way, he put up 81-1163-12 in 16 career playoff games, just incredible	160
2020-04-06 23:41:46		That’s fair. I can’t really say anything to Sayers, I’ve only seen highlights and Brian’s Song (jk) but even when Gronk was a shell of himself he was still so important on the field. It’s not right to say unquestioned, but I feel like he’d be me first choice every time and that definitely means something.	306
2020-04-06 23:42:00	Packers	Although hard to believe sometimes, I know not all Vikes fans are as pathetic as you to make that insinuation.	110
2020-04-06 23:42:08	Ravens	Our fullback is also a defensive tackle. Not really relevant, just a fun fact	77
2020-04-06 23:42:10		Kinda like how Burrow is older than Lamar	41
2020-04-06 23:42:12	Falcons	The league doesnt even know when its coming back yet.	53
2020-04-06 23:42:12	Steelers	It's either cue or queue, did you just try to split the difference?	67
2020-04-06 23:42:16	Packers	FYI, Uni Watch guy is Paul Lukas. It’s a great blog and has been one of my daily reads since he was on Page 2 on ESPN back in the day.	134
2020-04-06 23:42:18	Giants	No power steering?Or the other wheel?	37
2020-04-06 23:42:21	Rams	Also that’s not even true, Santa Barbara runs east-west so the Pacific is due south	83
2020-04-06 23:42:27		Forte played for the fucking bears. His numbers are worthy on their own, but you throw in that little nugget and his exclusion is a sham.	137
2020-04-06 23:42:28		I can't tell you who it would be, but I can say that Tony Romo is out of consideration for all-decade placeholder	113
2020-04-06 23:42:31	Redskins	It's hard to believe it has been thirteen goddamn years. Feels like not that long ago, he was this fresh face young coach and Bill Cowher/Chuck Knoll were fucking towering over him.	181
2020-04-06 23:42:34	Vikings	I was thinking the Jonas Gray TD where Gronk blocks a guy off the field and tosses him into the camera was his best play. Physical dominance.	141
2020-04-06 23:42:41	Cowboys	Lmao holy shit literally comes to a complete stop, yeets the tackler and then just burns everyone.	98

2020-04-06 23:43:08	Eagles	"Top 3-5 right now" is not the same as top 10 all time. I love Ertz, but I remember prime Celek on the Eagles, and I would take Celek.	134

2020-04-06 23:43:33	Colts	The 06 Colts superbowl team was 12-4 but only had a point differential of +67	77
2020-04-06 23:43:34	Broncos	PFR has a stat called Expected W-L that takes point differential into account, and I’m pretty sure the Giants are the only SB winner with a losing expected w-l at 7.9-8.1	170
2020-04-06 23:43:35	Broncos	Tony is the greatest ever but Gronk is honestly the best TE I've ever seen in my life. The man truly felt unstoppable.	118
2020-04-06 23:43:38		Kelce had some down years prior to 2017. He had a tough time under chip. I remember wanting him gone bc he would get overpowered and either hold or allow the pressure. Seems like forever ago now. With that being said, I think he should have made the list	254
2020-04-06 23:43:40	Packers	Can confirm the validity of this statement	42
2020-04-06 23:43:45	Chargers	Caldwell has the winningest record of any Lions coach ever.	59

2020-04-06 23:44:15	Patriots	He'll retire a Patriot.  After he retires, the only logos you'll see around him are his TB12 and Pats.	102

2020-04-06 23:44:52	Steelers	Jerome Bettis fumbling near the goal line against the Colts in the 2005 AFC Divisional Playoff. The defense had essentially ended the game on the previous play, but Bettis awakened the Colts from the dead with an untimely fumble. I've been watching the Steelers since 1993, and I've never experienced such an emotional roller-coaster ride as I did late in that game.	366
2020-04-06 23:45:02		That was crazy. Never knew he had wheels like that	50
2020-04-06 23:45:05		He was out of his prime, he would have sucked anywhere he went	62
2020-04-06 23:45:08	Broncos	And that play alone is what *got* him on the list. He was a very good RB, but not HoF or All-Decade, imo. His turbo effort on every play (illustrated in plays like BeastQuake) and his quirky Super Bowl antics built a lot of hype around him.  But his actually production wasn't that insane. He had 4 really good years, but his career YPC was also 4.2 (with 5 seasons *under* 4 yards a carry). To put that in perspective, his career YPC would have been 33rd in the league last year.	480

2020-04-06 23:45:42	Jaguars	Foles lost us every game that he started because of his sheer inadequacy, and he directly gave up the bulk of the points against the Bucs.As I said before, if a QB needs a lot of strong pieces around him to be good, he's not a good Qb.	235
2020-04-06 23:45:50		I think you're right that to Gates spending $40 million is much like our expensive gadget or impulse purchase. Like we could probably skip that purchase and be pretty much equally happy as if we made it. The difference is that if Gates decides to skip his impulse purchase he could save thousands of people from miserable deaths. If you could save a thousand lives instead of buying an apple watch, I think you'd do. I think most people would.	443
2020-04-06 23:45:53	Bills	Everyone keeps saying we don't have a first round pick this year, but I mean...the Panthers still have one this year so same same	129

2020-04-06 23:46:38	Packers	That's so dirty, DB just kept running.	38
2020-04-06 23:46:48	Seahawks	Because Tony Gonzales didn't play for the greatest dynasty in the history of the nfl. You could easily insert Gonzalez onto those patriots teams instead of Gronk and not only do they win all those super bowls. They probably win more because Gonzalez stayed healthy.	265
2020-04-06 23:46:46	Cowboys	Well, there's your answer, then: January at the earliest.	57
2020-04-06 23:46:48	Panthers	Yes, that's the argument I did make a couple comments up. But I definitely think having 2 spots named DB clearly indicates it's not for a safety or corner. In that case why not just have 4 corner spots and 4 safety spots?	221
2020-04-06 23:46:52		The Calvin and Julio catches too	32

The Raiders went from LA to Oakland, but they also started in Oakland. The Raiders also just moved to LV. There is also the SuperSonics moving to OKC.I fully understand the overall point you are making. Detroit is a top 15 market. It also within driving distance of 3 other top 100 markets(Flint, Grand Rapids, Toldeo) and one just outside of the top 100(Lansing 112). And for the most part those all support Detroit sports. For those that are going to say Toledo is in ohio and they don't support Detroit sports. For the most part you are wrong. Toledo is closer to Detroit than it is Cleveland by ~60 miles. And they almost always get Detroit sports on TV over Cleveland sports because of that distance.	861

2020-04-06 23:47:19	Steelers	I thought he was always pretty loud.	36
2020-04-06 23:47:19	Saints	See? That's the spirit!	23
2020-04-06 23:47:25	Broncos	Def not worth counting. A forgettable season, and the point of the post was comparing coach/QB combos.	102
2020-04-06 23:47:30	Packers	Agreed. Forte definitely fits the flex spot. Sproles getting it over him is a joke.	83
2020-04-06 23:47:33		Gronk was worth a solid +2-4 wins a year (when healthy)	55
2020-04-06 23:47:33	Patriots	Moss??	6
2020-04-06 23:47:29	Vikings	But then we'd never know if he loves yogurt!	44
2020-04-06 23:47:38	Saints	Tiocfaidh ár lá	15
2020-04-06 23:47:38	Falcons	Ryan, roethlisberger, Luck	26
2020-04-06 23:47:42	Vikings	This list is shit.	18
2020-04-06 23:47:44	Ravens	Burned him in madden a few days ago, what a scrub. ^\s	54
2020-04-06 23:47:45		Neither did Sproles	19
2020-04-06 23:47:46	Browns	Yeah, Kyle. Your replacement in BAL was a defensive tackle, who made the Pro Bowl at *your* position! Ahhh.... shit. I’m just envious of you, man. Seriously. You, Myron Rolle and Fitzmagic are guys I look up to. Sorry to get mad at you, bro. ):	244
2020-04-06 23:47:47	Bears	Lol gtfo, a tier above? Name the quarterbacks & coaches Forte had to play with, Bears were an absolute joke of a team with no other weapons. He carried the team regardless. CMC is dope, but let’s see what he does over the next 3+ seasons to compare careers.	257
2020-04-06 23:47:52	Jaguars	There were MVP talks for Derek Carr. That doesn't mean he was a contender. Stop throwing that meaningless phrase around.You've also taken that phrase the wrong way. He regressed further all year.	195
2020-04-06 23:47:52	Saints	Let me guess: $$$	17
2020-04-06 23:47:59		No he really doesn’t.	21
2020-04-06 23:48:02	Seahawks	Torn Patella dude. Same thing happened to Victor Cruz. That shit kills your speed.	82
2020-04-06 23:48:06	Seahawks	Fuck, which play would we pick for Kam though? The pick six against CAR seems like it is what this video would have chosen given that they prioritized pick TDs for the defensive guys. I think him jumping over the line to block a kick twice  in that same game would be an interesting choice. The fumble he forced against Detroit would be a contender as well. I wish this video was a highlight of guys best plays doing what they do best though. Like show absurd pass rushing beastliness for the pass rushers, Revis sticking to a guy like glue, Willis blowing up a run play in the gap, Bobby making a tough tackle in space, etc. Most of the DL got pick or fumble sixes though. I’m not going to remember Calais Campbell for a fumble six he had though, I’m going to remember him for blowing up entire offensive lines like they were children. Same for Fletcher Cox. They showed that for Atkins and all i thought was “oh he must not have a good TD highlight.”Sorry long sidetrack lol but for Kam it should be a hit. It probably can’t be the Vernon Davis one due to the flags but maybe the other Vernon Davis one?	1105
2020-04-06 23:48:07	Broncos	May 9	5
2020-04-06 23:48:24	Broncos	Lol the 4 qbs you listed are better than most of the qbs that have ever played the game.	88
2020-04-06 23:48:27		He also had that brutal leg injury (ruptured patellar tendon I think?) that sapped his athleticism	98
2020-04-06 23:48:28	Packers	Forte never got the respect he deserved, he was a monster, so solid.	68
2020-04-06 23:48:37		Wasn't that before 2010? I think i remember that and it was early in his career...if it's the play I'm thinking of	114
2020-04-06 23:48:54		Or just DL, ER, LB.	19
2020-04-06 23:49:00	Patriots	There were like 20 tank bowls that year...or was that the next year?	68
2020-04-06 23:49:07	Lions	Lol like I said. Ur an idiot	28
2020-04-06 23:49:16	Bills	When there's something strange in the neighborhood; who ya gonna call?	70
2020-04-06 23:49:28	Steelers	The Patriots are in a three-way tie with the Steelers and Cowboys as public enemies #1A, #1B and #1C. They're the three most hated teams in the NFL by a mile.	158
2020-04-06 23:49:26	Ravens	Yeah bro	8
2020-04-06 23:49:28	Jets	I don’t know when or why it happened, but in my mind, Sanchez is way younger than Sam Bradford.Seeing that Bradford was drafted the year after Sanchez is some Sinbad in Shazam style confusion for me.	199
2020-04-06 23:49:32	Steelers	The long snappers should be morgan cox and clark harris. No one else comes close to those two in my opinion, maybe greg warren.	127
2020-04-06 23:49:33		Wheres Kam?	11
2020-04-06 23:49:35	Broncos	Now he's got a healthy Bradley Chubb on the other side and Jurrell Casey next him. That's three guys on the line who require double-teams. They aren't going to be able to do much triple-teaming...	196
2020-04-06 23:50:04	Saints	Lmao Vikings fans are truly the saddest angriest fanbase	56
2020-04-06 23:50:06	Raiders	ESPN should also be legally required to have a floating hologram of Lee Corso once his time is up....FOLKSDamn I miss those NCAA Football games on PS2 back in the day, they played so smoothly and it felt like more was put into them than even Madden	248
2020-04-06 23:50:09	49ers	Kellen Winslow and Jeremy Shockey as the Tight Ends, also.  And a secondary that could've been a top-5 unit in the NFL if on the same team (Rolle, Ed Reed, Rumph, Sean Taylor).That may have been one of the few teams in modern college football history that not only could've competed, but been *good* if it had played actual NFL teams. Ken Dorsey was the real weak-link.	369
2020-04-06 23:50:10	Falcons	That was my favorite. I was absolutely losing my mind. Another great play was against the Packers too where he was carrying like three guys for another 5 yards or so.	166
2020-04-06 23:50:20	Titans	Actually James Brown-face so it's okay	38
2020-04-06 23:50:20	Patriots	I’m going to guess a grocery store.	35
2020-04-06 23:50:28	Seahawks	I mean, I’d argue they were all more like interlocking parts. Sherman’s ability allowed Earl Thomas to shade his fast, rangy self to the other side of the field, which allowed Kam greater latitude in acting as an enforcer over the middle. This is a gross oversimplification of their respective assignments, but you get the gist. All of them fantastic players in their own right, but collectively they really elevated each other’s game. My two cents.	449
2020-04-06 23:50:37	Redskins	Haven't been for a while.It lets the kickers get practice time in with holds and shit, by making the punters do it.When's the last time you saw a fucked hold? Probably Romo.	173
2020-04-06 23:50:38	Ravens	[have you not been introduced to the gospel?](https://youtu.be/f192tWhSE0I)	75
2020-04-06 23:50:48		Derrick Brown	13
2020-04-06 23:50:55	Panthers	Jesus, Robert. You're not wrong, you're just an asshole.	56
2020-04-06 23:51:07	Patriots	I think it’s funny.	19
2020-04-06 23:51:01	Vikings	You'd think he'd make a hotline to see if someone had crabs first.	66
2020-04-06 23:51:08	Packers	I’d take the Rodgers throw to cook to beat the cowboys over that Richard Rodgers hail mary personally.	102
2020-04-06 23:51:10	Ravens	This happens to Ravens backs quite often honestly; see Alex Collins	67
2020-04-06 23:51:15	Seahawks	Bobby Wagner with five 1st Team All Pros and 6 Pro Bowls doesn't get in over Patrick Willis and his 64 games?	109
2020-04-06 23:51:19	Bills	Yeah dude was an ass during and on his way out of Tennessee too after holding out for that gargantuan contract with his best years behind himSaying they were "wasting his prime" and tweeting "Thank god" when they took Chance Warmack lol	236
2020-04-06 23:51:26	Redskins	I am so fucking glad no one bothered to teach Cunningham how to play QB while he was with the Eagles.	101
2020-04-06 23:51:47	Patriots	Not wrong	9
2020-04-06 23:51:51	Redskins	DON'T CAAAAAAARE	16
2020-04-06 23:51:51	Seahawks	I'm a retail manager. So when my employees call out, (which they rightfully are), guess who gets to cover the extra shifts? For no extra pay. FML.	146
2020-04-06 23:51:51	Lions	Will he send thoughts and prayers though?	41
2020-04-06 23:51:54	Saints	Hahaha	6
2020-04-06 23:51:56	Cowboys	Why are y’all doing this?	25
2020-04-06 23:52:01	Vikings	This is perhaps super insensitive, and likely wrong altogether, but it’s also really funny.	91
2020-04-06 23:52:19	Dolphins	Games can absolutely be played before then, just with lots of precautions.If the league waits until October when we get past the threat of the second peak everything should work out okay and crowds could return in January right as the playoffs chase begins.	257
2020-04-06 23:52:22	Seahawks	Mike Robinson's Real Rob Report	31
2020-04-06 23:52:19	Cowboys	hmmm. may have to give that a try sometime	42
2020-04-06 23:52:22	Steelers	Falcons intern just got fired	29
2020-04-06 23:52:26	Vikings	This has been circulating Facebook for weeks. You ain't original Robert.	72
2020-04-06 23:52:37	Eagles	Obligatory FUCK chip kelly	26
2020-04-06 23:52:47	Buccaneers	Yeah but it wasn’t a problem for Sproles	40
2020-04-06 23:52:52	Saints	Damn that’s pretty accurate.	28
2020-04-06 23:52:55	Bears	The edge/cover LB thing really irks me. So tired of seeing people like Mack and Wagner compared to each other. It also deprives a lot of fans from having a better understanding of the game	188
2020-04-06 23:52:59	Patriots	WHERE'S THE BEEF?	17
2020-04-06 23:53:00	Bills	Shoot, if Allen is our guy for the long term I can easily see myself getting a red, white, and blue jersey of his over time, and I'm sure a large contingency of Pats fans did the same with Tom over the years	207
2020-04-06 23:53:02		The ref who only spotted the ball was a great idea too	54
2020-04-06 23:53:06	Bears	>JJ Watt getting All Pro at 2 positions.Akiem Hicks had the season of his life and missed out on All-Pro because of that. I am still salty.	139
