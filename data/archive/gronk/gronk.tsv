fo435t2	1587497403	Dolphins	team	This is a rbrandnewsentence
fo435u0	1587497403	Eagles	team	Hows that gate keeping? These babies are acting like he was walking around north Philly by himself
fo435vr	1587497404	Bears	nfl	No wonder there are still a few Trubisky Truthers out there.
fo435vv	1587497404	Texans	team	PHX obviously values him appropriately and if anyone other than OBrien was in charge of negotiations they would have found a way to get it done.Arizona. Geez dude. They literally can not, the salary cap is real. They have to pay Watson and Tunsil, also Cunningham, Reid, etc. Arizona can afford this because they have a QB on a rookie contract.Nuk was the face of this teamYou spelt Deshaun Watson wrong.When they trade WAtSoN over some dumb excuse how will you blame Deshaun?Wait, what? Youve lost me with this rambling. Trade Watson blame Deshaun? Youre reaching bruh. Hopkins wanted more money and out of Houston. He got it.
fo436j2	1587497412	Lions	team	Haskins has literally nothing in common with Alex Smith.  And how many rookies(and look at the WR he had) have stellar seasons
fo436l6	1587497413	Cowboys	nfl	There clearly is an asterisk(httpsimgur.comahdKEU1T)Please stop harassing me
fo436w4	1587497418	Patriots	team	This dude fucking sucks lmao
fo436j7	1587497412	Dolphins	team	Mortenson needs to be more specific.
fo4373t	1587497421	Chargers	team	Printed vs stitched numbers and Nike logos. Also the vapor has a little more of a slimstructured cut.
fo4370f	1587497419	Jets	team	He was hurt last year, and Joey Slye did decently well in his place as a rookie. Whichever one of them loses the battle this year would be a great pick up
fo4376n	1587497422	Dolphins	nfl	Yeah but last year we were trying to lose.
fo437d2	1587497424	Chiefs	nfl	Verified on Twitter with 44k followers, but is a Philly native who may just hope he falls to the Eagles.
fo4378i	1587497422	Rams	nfl	The Ravens 15 is pretty impressive considering they are less than half the age of most teams in the league.
fo437d5	1587497424	Packers	nfl	Screw that Im not keeping up with it anymore.  Ill be like my dad talking about us going up against Baltimore with that andrew luck guy.
fo437kw	1587497427	Jets	team	In Josh Allens lifetime Mark Sanchez has four times as many playoff wins as the entire franchise he plays for
fo437mj	1587497428	Panthers	team	Its not destroying your culture of your team is just bad. And our defense is probably the worst in the league. Dont care what kind of coach you have, cant do but so much. Nothing wrong with not succeeding your first year when you have a 7 year deal
fo437oo	1587497429	Jets	team	I would have much rather taken Andrew Thomas.
fo437q2	1587497430	Cardinals	team	These are my favorite I have seen aside from the state flag concept that has been passed around for a while. These are HOT
fo4387d	1587497436	Eagles	nfl	GIMMIE JUDGE
fo437zd	1587497433	Panthers	team	Hell yeah Kyle Dugger. Go Bears!
fo4381w	1587497434	Titans	team	Casey  err... nevermind.Lewan, AJ Brown, Byard are probably your safest bets.
fo438rq	1587497444	Jets	nfl	I work at a fortune 500 company and I know for a fact our CFO and other Csuite execs have fallen for incredibly basic phishing schemes and has sent security into code red more than once. A sizeable portion of the older generation just straight up struggles with technology, no matter how smartaccomplished they are, mainly from not growing up with it like most of the young generations have, and GMs are typically older.
fo438li	1587497442	Broncos	team	Sorry about your username. Didnt age very well.
fo438tf	1587497445	Saints	nfl	Exactly. He complained about the rpos were breaking the game with lineman 510 yards down field on a pass play. The nfl rule is only one yard vs 3 in college and its never properly called. So a bit of a whine, but a legitimate complaint when trying to play defense. Also hurry up offenses put more strain on a defense and causes teams to fake injuries
fo43907	1587497447	Broncos	team	He has a hard time accepting responsibility for things that go sour. On the field and off, he is quick to blame.
fo439id	1587497454	Seahawks	nfl	Andre Johnson. One of the most underrated receivers and got old right when the Texans finally started to put something together. Id say him, Calvin Johnson, priest Holmes and saquan (even though its still really early for him).
fo4392q	1587497448	Panthers	nfl	No
fo439g7	1587497453	Broncos	team	uCodyRoarkNFL is there a convenient way to revisit all of these film breakdowns? perhaps a some kind of Tube where You have collected all the videos and I could watch them at any time?
fo439uq	1587497458	Eagles	team	Like Im wrong?
fo439ht	1587497453	Patriots	nfl	Well Jackson is not a very accurate QB, which isnt really news to anyone. He plays in a scheme that maximizes what he does well and forces defenses into one on ones with his skill position players,
fo439jb	1587497454	Broncos	team	Said he was committed to using the run to manage time and open up PA.  Also said hes aware of the value of being able to produce big plays in the pass game (via Andy Reid).  The jury is still out on him as far as Im concerned, but hes been doin it for a long while and ought to know what works and has the tenure to have been exposed to a lot of defenses, so...  Ill get a fair shake from m.
fo439rc	1587497457	Broncos	nfl	Boomer  Athena
fo439y0	1587497460	Browns	team	I say it because.....it is. If youve never played on the line I can see the skepticism but making the switch from right to left isnt hard at all. If its this insanely hard thing then sign me to a contract lol.
fo43a3k	1587497462	Chargers	team	Seahawks fan here. Congratulations on going from my favorite jerseys in the league to still my favorite jerseys in the league. Powder blues are the best example Ive seen of a modern take on a classic design. The navy blues are just plain sick. Only one i dont care for is the royal blue. A bit too Rams like and it seems unnecessary with the new Navy set. 1010 overall. Id love to see a Thursday night game with the Chargers in navy blue and the Seahawks in action green!
fo439ua	1587497458	Bengals	team	Dang, I didnt realize we had to pick it up before the 4th year
fo43ac6	1587497465	Buccaneers	team	Jameis wasnt ever getting the tag though. That was always reserved for shaq. Jameis deal wouldve been in the neighborhood of what brady got
fo43act	1587497465	Chargers	team	Thats why Im not too worried about who we draft at 6. I trust TT and the rest of the scouting team to make the best decision for the franchise.
fo43a22	1587497461	Chargers	nfl	Aint this the truth. I know a guy whos a Packers, Celtics, Braves, and Canadians fans...how the fuck?

fo43as5	1587497471	Bills	nfl	I remember this guy. He claims the site owner threatened him, without providing any proof, and thinks hes a hypocrite because he dares to have ads on his website but prefers there arent any on uniforms.

fo43b7q	1587497476	Lions	team	Or if Miami moves up to two to take an OT, Ill eat both shoes.

fo43awb	1587497472	Broncos	team	PoWDur BluEZ.Heard all three fans in LA gave a small fist pump followed by not being able to name the new starting QB.
fo43b1i	1587497474	Jaguars	nfl	You mean the Jags are going to get a 1st round talent in the 2nd? Okay!
fo43b7s	1587497476	Titans	nfl	I think I personally could do fine with a very long football talk. I manage to annoy most of my friends as is lol. If it was my full time job I definitely think I could learn enough nuance of the game to recruit like that. But then Id get fired for something else, and the cycle continues
fo43aqi	1587497470	Chargers	team	cant stop laughing
fo43ba1	1587497477	Lions	team	Finding new ways to be the joke
fo43bbk	1587497478	Texans	team	I mean that would be cool. Dunn is a solid run stuffer but not a pass rusher.  Jernigans deal is essentially a little over 1M though unless he hits goals and maxes out just over 3M I think.  If hes a starter then thats an unbelievably great GM move.  My feeling is Omenihu and a Rookie pick at 40 end up starting with Jernigan for vet depth on 43 looks and Dunn will be used as a NT on 34 Looks.
fo43bq5	1587497483	Colts	team	Seriously, it blows me away when people act like he should be untouchable. Hes been okay, but nothing spectacular. Last year his tackling was sub par and he took bad angles a lot. The potential is definitely there and I dont really agree with trading him yet, but Im not gonna be heartbroken if they move him
fo43btw	1587497485	Patriots	team	Its because Seymour was from the 2000s Patriots and many redditors are too young to remember him if theyre in their 20s right now.
fo43boe	1587497483	Jets	team	I made my mind on OL first no matter what because there is sooo much talent available for the WR position in the later rounds
fo43bp9	1587497483	49ers	team	DJ is significantly more uh stoutI dont think a nose tackle is going to slide over to 3 tech
fo43c2b	1587497488	Seahawks	team	This guy got alot of comparisons to Earl Thomas and Ed Reed coming out of college and he was a predominately single high saftey in college that dominated in the middle of the field. I guess the Colts never really used him in the right scheme and he has some injury history. Still a pretty tantalizing saftey talent.
fo43bkt	1587497481	Lions	nfl	Its 230pmI have a giant report due for workIve done basically nothingTime to crack a beer

fo43brx	1587497484	Dolphins	team	The darkest timeline.
fo43cd5	1587497492	Bills	team	Thanks, updated comment to reflect the correct opponents and win totals!
fo43bzs	1587497487	Packers	team	The Patriots unprecedented, and likely unrepeatable, success over the last 20 years has made this such a common narrative, but the reality is winning even one super bowl is hard af.  Thats the reason Favre, Rodgers, Brees and other amazing QBs have only won one.  Other greats also havent even won one.  Entire FRANCHISES havent even won one despite existing for over 50 years (I wont name names ahem Lions, Vikings) despite have incredible teams over the years that arguably should have won. So this whole narrative that his career was wasted is old and dumb.  The stars must align in order to come out on top, and there are some factors that just cant be planned for or helped.  That being said, the Packers will win the next 4 SB titles and Rodgers will ride off into the sunset as the best QB of all time.
fo43c6f	1587497489	Colts	nfl	Belichick
fo43crl	1587497497	Packers	nfl	Joe Thomas. Man legit didnt know who his qb was at one point during a game, deserved so much better
fo43cha	1587497493	Dolphins	team	Theyre rolling into next year as they have lots of contracts to sign. So not really ahead of us tbh
fo43coc	1587497496	Patriots	team	LSUs KLavon Chaisson is the perfect scheme fit for us, as a hybrid combo of Chandler Jones and Jamie Collins as the SLB in our 34.He sets a phenomenal edge, which is the most important thing for a Belichick edge defender, excels on inside stunt rushes, has good speed and foot quickness, and has shown ability to play man coverage on RBs and TEs.He might drop as his ability as a pure power rusher is raw, but we seldom use those types of roles. Hes a nearperfect player for us, and I wouldnt even mind moving up to grab him. And for those who say BB doesnt trade up in the first... we did in 2012, moving up from 27 to 21 for Chandler Jones (and 31 to 25 for Hightower)
fo43cp6	1587497496	49ers	nfl	FFX  FFVIII  FFVII  FFIX I honestly dont remember much about it. Might need to replay it. 10 is easily my favorite though. Replayed that game at least 13 times
fo43cy3	1587497500	Ravens	nfl	And Lamar is top 5
fo43chr	1587497493	Dolphins	team	On one hand... The jets didnt stab their fans in the back like he did. Sabans just an assholeOn the other hand...FTJ
fo43d05	1587497501	Patriots	team	Pats were definitely one of the worst in terms of the new jersey reveals. Behind probably only Atlanta.
fo43d0j	1587497501	Cowboys	nfl	 but Tua and his family are massive CowboysIm picturing 15 foot tall ranchersAs much as I think Dak is a franchise QB I dont think trading up for Tua is the worst idea. Even the Dak truthers have to admit it makes some sense to do that.
fo43czd	1587497500	Colts	team	Step 1 Draft Jackson and GreenStep 2Play Jackson at QB and Green at WRStep 3 ???Step 4 PROFIT!Can you believe were going to get our franchise QB and our 1 receiver in the same draft?!
fo43d8i	1587497504	Chargers	team	Either TT is fine with Herbert or not.  If he wants Tua then he trades up. Sitting and hoping doesnt get it done. If Tua is the franchise in his opinion you dont just leave it to chance.
fo43dci	1587497505	Lions	nfl	Lions have had basically no predraft leaks under Bob Quinn. Nobody knew they were thinking about Frank Ragnow a couple of years back, it surprised everyone. I would doubt anyone has the inside scoop on what we are going to do.
fo43don	1587497510	Bears	team	haha.  That is so true. McMahon swagger was legit.
fo43djk	1587497508	Packers	team	This TE class is very weak. Decent depth but the top guys are bad. Sternberger wouldve been the 1 TE in this class. We got our guy. He basically redshirted last season and wouldve cost us a second or even a first this year. Packers got a great value. Last year was one of the most stacked TE classes in years, and we got the 4th best one in the class. Grossi has an interview with Sternberger who says he would be TE1 this year easily, according to his coach. I agree with him. This WR class is so, so much better that we need to get one. I agree Rodgers needs more pass catchers in general, not just WR. But the way this draft is, WR is definitely the answer. Pittman Jr., who will definitely be available for us if we want him, would immediately be the second best WR on the roster.
fo43doe	1587497510	Ravens	nfl	Disclaimer on P5R, you must have a base level of tolerance for anime shit.
fo43dxu	1587497514	Lions	team	Simmons is Brian Urlacher. ILBS hybrid
fo43e3n	1587497516	Ravens	team	Its a shame Madden is such a trash game
fo43e4k	1587497516	Eagles	nfl	Seeing as though every quarterback fumbles when you breathe in their direction this statement is false.
fo43e4q	1587497516	Chargers	team	Look great! Way better than the Pats ones. Also I think due to helmet regulations that they have to use the same helmets...imagine being the guy who has to change the decals week to week with the small lumbers on the side changing with the uniform main color!
fo43ea0	1587497518	Bills	team	106 after resting our starters in a meaningless game against the Jets. Lol.
fo43eh6	1587497521	Giants	team	I dont think we need to be too worried about him transitioning to the Left Side he is only on the right because Tua is a Lefty. May need some time in the offseason to switch up his form. But given the uncertainty of everything right now because of Corona I think it might be a good thing he can plug and play RT for this season then transition to left in 2021.
fo43e5c	1587497516	Patriots	nfl	What the actual fuck are you even talking about in your 2 pixel comment lol.  Jesus christ trolls.  You went on the offensive against me calling me a clown and telling me I cant read and now claiming Im harassing you.  Seriously, what are you getting out of this?
fo43e70	1587497517	Browns	team	Thats a neat one. It throws me off how PFF has Chinn going in the 3rd round all the time, I just dont think thats that happens but safeties do drop so who knows.
fo43ec1	1587497519	Lions	team	Does it violate the Michigan quarantine order for Lancaster to go to Quinns driveway for work, since sports are nonessential?
fo43ejd	1587497522	Eagles	team	Ah, the Jay Ajayi technique. Agreed, nobody should risk it until at the EARLIEST...say 21?
fo43esa	1587497525	Lions	team	Armani Oruwaryie made leaps of improvement finishing last season. He is our future cb1.Imagine believing this when he barely was even playing by the end of last season. Could it be true? Maybe. Should you risk our season on it being true? Absolutely not.
fo43ese	1587497525	Seahawks	team	It never claimed to be the full story or whatever. Its a highlight video that ends in the super bowl victory

fo43ev3	1587497526	Lions	team	Just put it on auto pick, best available. Sure we will end up with three tight ends and no kicker but we can get one of those off wavers.

fo43fxl	1587497540	Chargers	nfl	Yup
fo43fy9	1587497540	Vikings	team	I agree with everything youve said here. Just wanna jump on real quick and say the Jets have been a shit franchise since their one super bowl with Joe Namath. The Vikings have been almost the opposite and more accomplished since then (obviously besides not being able to get the Holy Grail).So a not very good, young QB in Darnold being in the top 5 of most Jets passing marks does not surprise me one bit. At least the Skins have some history. But youre definitely right. Its hard to luck into a franchise QB.
fo43fjs	1587497535	Dolphins	team	This place is gonna be a shit show if we dont get tua

What did bob do wrong?Deandre wanted off the team, now deandre is off the team, and 28 and looking to be the highest paid non qb after a downslope in production. That mf bob should be praised. Stop being a sheep and actually think about it.
fo43gfn	1587497547	Giants	nfl	Depends, what are the Giants getting? if the Giants are only getting the 9th pick what better is it than drafting at 4th?

He went like 7 picks later, get with itGettleman Jeeze I dont know man its been hard to hear some of these names, just give me the best punter left in the draft
fo43hk2	1587497563	Cardinals	nfl	What are you talking about? Nuk is in his prime. And he has not much leverage because he still has 3 years on his contract. Are they talking about an extension? Yeah. But he has not as much leverage like a Ramsey has. You wanna hold out for a new contract? Yeah go ahead and miss out on atleast 12m  under the new CBA.
fo43hmg	1587497564	Dolphins	team	Lets not be dumb.
fo43h7t	1587497558	Lions	nfl	Are we talking about Patriots Legend and Super Bowl Champion Darrelle Revis?
fo43hcr	1587497560	Eagles	nfl	That I understand. But Im talking about the people who insist on arguing the most minuscule details about everything like my bad bro I was one pick off fuckin kill me I guess
fo43hpj	1587497565	49ers	nfl	It seems better but the fact that its not turn based and they changed the story and introduced some new characters and removed some made me lose interest. And that its open world for no discernible reason
fo43hwc	1587497568	Buccaneers	team	Incentives count retroactively if he reaches them. So hell go into the season with a cap of 25 million no matter what, but at the end of the season if he reaches them they get added to his cap hit.
fo43iba	1587497573	Redskins	nfl	In the prior thread I complained about the inability to make proper Chinese at home because it tastes different from restaurants, and I bemoaned the lack of open chinese restaurants as making it at home is not the same.

fo43igz	1587497575	Patriots	team	It would be hilarious and awesome if the Pats version of tanking for Tua was getting bounced in the divisional round. I would fucking love for this to happen but realistically I dont see Tua sliding out of the top 10. Theres a lot of smoke out there.

fo43is0	1587497580	Lions	team	Seems odd to have the director of IT do this type of shit.  All the directors I know in my IT department would be almost useless resolving any sort of actual issues.  Just put a tech in the driveway instead haha.
fo43iwl	1587497581	Ravens	team	My only critique is the TE. Id much rather take Lynn Bowden or Van Jefferson at 92. If that happened I would die of happiness with this mock.
fo43izq	1587497582	Broncos	team	httpswww.sharpfootballstats.compersonnelgroupingfrequency.htmlBy my count there were 18 teams that used two TE sets, in 12 or 22, more often than the Giants. While only six teams used 11 personnel at a higher frequency.

fo43ix3	1587497581	Giants	nfl	What are you even talking about man...Its like mahomes wasnt injured or anything. All those teams you listed have nothing to do with the chiefs. And I continue to not see how a first round db mitigates that off game you keep dreaming about. You dont build a roster for an off game
fo43ixf	1587497582	Jaguars	team	I honestly feel his stock is as high as it was ever going to get. Minshew opened the door to the fact that he will he draftable, but his talents couldnt even translate to NCAA wins. I think we are fine at qb honestly. Hes most likely going to be a UDFA. Dobbs is serviceable as a backup.
fo43j8l	1587497586	Lions	nfl	Some even argued he was a better prospect than Peyton and was the best since Elway (the three generational prospects are usually considered Elway, Peyton, Luck, and Trevor Lawrence might be one too).
fo43j2v	1587497584	Lions	team	I dont believe any of these rumors. Some saying nobodys trading with Detroit at all and some saying theres talk of it happening its annoying as hell
fo43j89	1587497586	Titans	team	Where are the mms?
fo43jgy	1587497589	Rams	team	Ive made this point about why uniforms would be released before the draft, because even if we dont have a 1st round pick, the NFL would still have them incase of a trade.But since its online now, that goes right out the window.
fo43jmz	1587497591	Falcons	team	64, 238 lbs is undersized?
fo43jsr	1587497594	Lions	team	Clowney is different from Young though, he kept his spot despite his production because he looked like a generational athlete, Young has the athleticism and the production.
fo43jxo	1587497596	Panthers	nfl	And a 5050 chance you win MVP and take your team to the Superbowl
fo43k1p	1587497597	Bears	team	Lmao. You forgot the s
fo43k2k	1587497597	Eagles	team	Fucking right we did(httpsgetyarn.ioyarnclipd376bb62c0e649f5900f72fc59e92a66)
fo43k6u	1587497599	Cowboys	nfl	By depthadjusted completion percentage it is still Brees at the top, but Jameis comes out well above replacement level  around league average. Minshew drops to last among QBs with a 320 play minimum.This is all per this chart(httpspbs.twimg.commediaENEDldXXkAE7BZ8?formatjpgname4096x4096). Wish I knew a more organized place to find this stuff.The top five are Brees, Tannehill, Carr, Cousins, and Wilson.The bottom five are Minshew, Dalton, Mayfield, Jones, and Brady.
fo43k7r	1587497600	Lions	nfl	I taught my VP how to use a lot of basic Excel functionality. When he was setting up a sequence in a spreadsheet to track project tasks he was copypasting line by line then manually editing the number.He never knew how to dragdoubleclick to auto populate series or copy formulas.
fo43k6k	1587497599	Texans	nfl	Youre ignorant.  This isnt because all their picks sucks its because theyre all injured immediately.  This ones poor luck.
fo43k45	1587497598	Giants	team	I like Wirfs more than most but Wills is very good as well. Personally both are in my top tier of OTs.
fo43kq2	1587497606	49ers	nfl	Hooray!
fo43kn2	1587497605	Patriots	team	Been saying this since Tom left. Gilly, Thuney, a midround and our first round to the Lions for their first round. With that we draft Tua. Thats my unpopular crazy opinion lol
fo43klu	1587497605	Vikings	nfl	Havent you guys never beat the Vikings also?
fo43kqv	1587497607	Falcons	team	Team 3 because you know Bobby Petrino is bringing hookers.
fo43ksy	1587497607	Patriots	nfl	So you cant think of a use case in business today? Cause you said companies do much hardertechnical things every day.Literally no one is saying its an impossible task. What people who understand video conferencing and large groups are saying is that its not an easy task.
fo43ky5	1587497609	Bengals	nfl	Hubbard was a third.
fo43lbg	1587497614	Jaguars	nfl	Bad enough that we get Trevor Lawrence
fo43ld5	1587497615	Ravens	team	Im not touching Madden unless they actually improve the game for once. Its rehashed bullshit year after year
fo43lco	1587497615	Colts	team	Check out Glow  2nd from top left and Smith  one down from Reich having the battleofthebeards lol
fo43lqa	1587497619	49ers	team	Joe Williams now thats a name I havent heard in a long time
fo43lqy	1587497619	Chargers	nfl	In the event of no training camp etc., which rookie positions do you think will be the most impacted? Could we see an unprecedented number of rookies riding the bench?
fo43law	1587497614	Panthers	team	I dont think hes a top10 pick.
fo43lcp	1587497615	Bears	team	No no hes not
fo43lju	1587497617	Cowboys	nfl	If you want to choose not to look at the image thats on you. Im going to block you now because youre clearly just trolling
fo43lp1	1587497619	Chargers	nfl	The problem is if they spread it amongst each other they bring it to the grocery store, the bank, the post office, etc.
fo43m61	1587497625	Chargers	team	I still havent given up on tillery he was still recovering from injury and most NFL DTs dont produce year one
fo43m7z	1587497626	Buccaneers	nfl	Yeah the Bucs video was pretty annoying. Just line them up take some pics and post them. No need for the flashing lights and theatrics
fo43mid	1587497630	Jets	team	I really hate when ppl say hes just a SS, hes a jack of all trades (and master of all)  incredible IQ that wrecks games, def worth 1516 a year
fo43m6x	1587497626	Eagles	team	He is such a good guy, he shouldt be booed anywhere.  Patriots fans even like the guy.  The way Jaguars fans trash him is sickening, he played literally 3 games worth of snaps sandwiched between a major injury. Its not his fault their team signed a pocket QB with no line.
fo43m8o	1587497626	Eagles	nfl	1 correct2 correct
fo43mca	1587497628	Packers	nfl	Damn, guess well settle for Juedy at 30
fo43mhx	1587497630	49ers	nfl	I know there are some ford haters here but you gotta appreciate the sound a 5.0 makes when you put the hammer down
fo43mva	1587497635	Broncos	team	I hate I admit it but the navy blue one is fire
fo43n0m	1587497637	Patriots	nfl	The most classic sign of the troll
fo43msn	1587497634	Falcons	nfl	Dude he was on a 106 team
fo43mzd	1587497636	Ravens	team	Just FYI they usually go on sale around ThanksgivingBlack Friday, even in the online stores the last couple years.
fo43mt5	1587497634	Eagles	nfl	Burn!
fo43naw	1587497640	Lions	nfl	Hes basically the GOAT
fo43mss	1587497634	Falcons	team	Accurate assessment
fo43n0q	1587497637	Eagles	team	yea seriously, Markelle made up a better injury as a rookie. agholor is a bum
fo43n6c	1587497639	Lions	team	Clowney is one of the most effective pass rushers in football. Hes also played at least 13 games in 5 straight seasons. I think you need to revise your definition of a successful player.As for Ferrell, he was not projected to be picked at 4 overall, he was valued as a late first round pick by most  so hes not a very good contrast to Chase Young.Dion Jordan had a ton of red flags for off field stuff going into the draft and the Dolphins went for him anyway.Chase young is none of those things. Every pass rusher with a grade as good as Young has been a game changing player at the NFL level. There are no real exceptions.
fo43nbh	1587497641	Jets	team	You say he was a bad pick at 3 and then you blame the coaches for not developing him to be worthy of the draft position?  You cant have it both ways dude.  Either he has the potential to be a monster and he deserved to be picked there or he was always just going to be a runstuffing DT.  Pick one.My reason for saying that is guys like Bless, Phillips, Foley, Shepherd, etc. all improving.  The only guys who had bad years, imo, were Trumaine, Henry Anderson, and Darryl Roberts.
fo43nkd	1587497644	Colts	nfl	Yeah, but my understanding is thats not the story he was telling. I live in South Florida so I could be just getting a biased version, but what Ive heard is that he basically absolved himself of any responsibility.
fo43o0m	1587497650	Lions	nfl	Tom Hanks.
fo43o9k	1587497653	Texans	nfl	Really dont know if Hopkins could be my favorite player anymore. He played this perfectly as far as maximizing his career earnings. That doesnt change the fact that it is incredibly selfish to threaten a hold out with 3 years remaining on a contract that made him the 2nd highest paid at his position...He was paid 52.3 million over the last 3 seasons if you include the signing bonus were on the hook for.Compare how Julio handled his situation with how Hopkins handled his.
fo43obv	1587497654	Colts	nfl	The Indianapolis Colts didnt exist until 1984.
fo43o38	1587497651	Buccaneers	nfl	The ultimate power move
fo43ogu	1587497656	Jets	nfl	In what world does James Lynch go 15?!?!?
fo43ojf	1587497657	Chargers	nfl	Me
fo43oky	1587497657	Broncos	team	Me too
fo43oo2	1587497659	Texans	team	Man, youre conveniently leaving out everything else I said and focused on my worstcase scenario? Im not saying it will happen, but if they are not successful and BoB retains the power and acts the way he currently has with players (Clowney and Hopkins) I absolutely can see Watson asking to be moved.
fo43p26	1587497664	Eagles	nfl	Lose the helmet numbers, other than that these are great
fo43ojs	1587497657	Patriots	nfl	Hopefully our new color rushs are red
fo43op6	1587497659	Bengals	team	Difference between LSU and TCU talent wise
fo43oy0	1587497662	Ravens	nfl	Is that like a bukkake while solving a sudoku?
fo43pdx	1587497668	Ravens	team	Perfect Storm
fo43pn5	1587497671	Vikings	team	Oh yeah, the Jets chug, but theyve been around for a long time. The Skins were good for a while but still Cousins was their best QB in the last 30 years and 90 of their fanbase is convinced they made the right choice letting him go.
fo43ps3	1587497673	Dolphins	team	Lol this is a worst analogy than something Cowherd would pull out of his ass live. Thats a really low bar to meet.
fo43ps7	1587497673	Eagles	team	It would be like when Chase Utley returned to CBP and demolished us but we went wild and cheered his homeruns.
fo43p2p	1587497664	Seahawks	team	You know, now that you put it like that I dont completely disagree. I still think our jerseys are fine now, but I definitely see what youre saying. I still do think it might just be a little too early to change them totally
fo43p4s	1587497665	Lions	team	Eh, its draft week. See a ton of BS this time of year, unfortunately. Teamsagentsplayersmedia are all to blame.
fo43pan	1587497667	Giants	team	Would love to trade up for Ruiz.San Francisco at 31 would be the perfect spot.
fo43pbj	1587497667	Browns	nfl	Exactly. Almost everybody has our number.Lately the Ravens havent had our number, weve been pretty close in games and split the last two years. But besides them and the Jets, I cant think of anyone.
fo43ph8	1587497669	Chargers	team	runs draw play up the middle
fo43plx	1587497671	Cowboys	nfl	In 2016? No. That offense was all Zeke and the Offensive Line. Had they lost one or two games in that streak, theyre still in the playoffs with Romo back in his spot.OT loss to the Eagles or losing to the Steelers and Romo gets his spot back week 910 and theyre a better team. And if Romo is hurt again? The question is answered and were on to Dak without lingering questions. And they lost in the 1st round against the Packers. They had the 30th ranked secondary. They made a great come back and fell short...after Dak dug a hole in the first half and couldnt move the ball. Looking good against prevent defense doesnt make you great. Cant tell me Romo wouldnt have sustained drives in the 1st half better that game.
fo43pvk	1587497674	Colts	team	Im from the NY tri state area and this guy is notorious around here. He just throws shit at the wall to see what sticks. I think the only thing he ever broke that was true was Revis ending one of his lockouts.
fo43q1g	1587497677	49ers	nfl	You should always assume the worst but hope for the best.Unless youre talking about something involving ujawnlobotomy when you should assume the best but hope for the worst! As in oh Jawn went fishing....but I hope the store ran out of his favorite beer!
fo43qhg	1587497683	Titans	nfl	Reference to moviesvideo games and no ecigarettes are what I put my money on. Itll be a call of duty case lying around or someones brother smoking a juju. Where do I place my bet?
fo43q5r	1587497678	Texans	team	Im still bummed the Astros lost the WS and turned into pariahs. Now theres ALL of this time with no news and the same old stories getting beaten to death.
fo43qgc	1587497682	Giants	nfl	Yeah that would be fantastic
fo43qo7	1587497686	Rams	team	Ya Ive been defending the logo for awhile on here and getting consistent upvotes. Im always worried Ill get downvoted to oblivion but there are a lot of people who do like the rebrand
fo43r20	1587497691	Broncos	team	Apparently not?..........
fo43r4a	1587497691	Browns	team	Id be happy getting PeoplesJones later in the draft.  I think hed be a very solid WR 3
fo43r7g	1587497693	49ers	team	Maiocco is the best 49ers insider by 100 miles. Nobody has more info and better info than he does. And Turner has talked to Taylor more than any other RB. Ive learned to not doubt Maiocco.  And calling him a Boomer as an insult is pretty stupid too.
fo43r96	1587497693	Vikings	team	Just being pedantic but I feel the same way. When we mention average  or above average QB, dont the stats you mention suggest that these are actually much above the averagenorm? What I mean is, If most franchises dont have long histories of consistent starting QBs, does that mean that not having a consistent productive quarterback is really the average? Just a thought but its interesting because, looking at our history, if just having a consistent productive QB is what is keeping us from winning a super bowl, cant the same be said for nearly every other team?
fo43rjq	1587497697	Jets	team	Boyz fans are like, tweet jamal to cowboys now schefter. They didnt even pay for their qb yet but they want another player thats gonna demand an incredibly high salary.
fo43rn6	1587497698	Falcons	team	For a defensive end or edge rusher, yes. Vic Beasley is 63, 236 for comparison.
fo43rh5	1587497696	Titans	team	Lol but he didnt get the title did he? If we wouldve scored more points than the chiefs we probably wouldve been In The super bowl lol dumb fucking logic there
fo43rg9	1587497696	Steelers	team	chinn has flown up boards in the past month or so, id be surprised if he made it past 35 tbh. im just happy its not a DT at 49i would personally go for a later TE like a dalton keane and bump  up ILB as a need but if the draft did go this way you could use chinn in that baronbig nickel type role instead (not sure how they feel about UGIII).
fo43s5d	1587497705	Seahawks	nfl	(X) Doubt
fo43rb6	1587497694	Seahawks	nfl	Calling Jamal Adams a veteran is really scraping the bare minimum to meet the requirements of that term, and only because you technically become a vested veteran after 3 years in the league. I just feel its kinda phony.Welcome to my TED talk.
fo43rdu	1587497695	Patriots	team	I want Tua. I know its the less popular opinion on here, but I think its worth the trade up. Hes exceptionally talented and I think he can be the leader the team needs. More importantly, he looks ready to start day 1 without needing as much polish as some of the other prospects. I like Stidham, but I just dont know if hes really the guy.
fo43ro9	1587497698	Saints	team	Hes blind thohttpstwitter.comalltwentytwostatus1250533052448567297?s21
fo43rzf	1587497703	Eagles	team	Not really a hot take, if we arent so WR dependent right now LB is great value in the first right now.
fo43s1t	1587497703	Colts	team	Answer the question! ARE YOU ON THE RECORD?! s
fo43s7g	1587497705	Packers	nfl	Not since always. GB beat them 3 years in a row the 90s, niners got that one in 98 tho
fo43s9p	1587497706	Redskins	nfl	fucking online recipes tell a 80 page long war and peace story before giving you the fuckin recipejust gimme the ingredients and tell me what to do
fo43soc	1587497711	Chargers	team	Man all these vets talking has me feeling nostalgic!
fo43spo	1587497712	Vikings	nfl	He played ST and was barely a rotational player his 1st year (maybe 25 of snaps) with 6 sacks. His second year I think he was around 5075 of snaps and had 12 or so sacks.
fo43tbv	1587497720	Jets	team	I am TOTALLY against going with a defensive player at 11. But... Okudah fell to me in a mock I just did and wanted to see how it came out anyway. Managed to get a startable albeit raw zone LT in Cleveland, my 2 favorite mid round receivers and more important roster pieces. httpsimgur.comawNGvYUm
fo43tcb	1587497720	Vikings	team	 Bye.LMFAO Thank god! You are a moron. Ive added you to the moron list.This sucks.  Its pathetic.  Before you go  just give it one more try.  You have to have something far better than this pathetic nonsense.  Give it your all!
fo43t9x	1587497720	Chargers	team	If that was true Marlon mcree wouldve held on to the football
fo43ta1	1587497720	Broncos	team	Say the Chargers get Simmons, their defense wpuld be absolutely loaded
fo43trs	1587497726	Steelers	nfl	Holy shit, this is the guy from the first season of 90 day fianc
fo43to2	1587497725	Buccaneers	team	Anyway BLOCKED. Congrats to the winners.
fo43u53	1587497731	Texans	nfl	Its worse than that. So Deshaun and DeAndre and really good friends. So after DeAndre was traded, Deshaun liked a bunch of comments on social media about how dumb that trade was and how dumb O Brien is. Add that to DeAndre saying he has no relationship after 6 years with his HC. How is that even possible. 6 years and no relationship with your star player.
fo43tn6	1587497724	Packers	team	Vet minimum, hes worth the shot.Also everyones forgetting about EQ.  And MVS in his third year could break out still. Not saying hes anywhere close to Adams but we all wrote Davante off after year 2...
fo43ucf	1587497733	Bears	team	Yes.  I completely agree on both points
fo43tre	1587497726	Dolphins	team	lol, we are guaranteed a top tackle at 5
fo43txm	1587497728	Dolphins	nfl	You made the comparison. You said Elway is the the comparison because he dragged talentless teams to the Superbowl and Marino didnt.Im pointing out that Elway didnt drag talentless teams to the SB. Those teams had plenty of defensive talent. And on top of that Elway himself wasnt exactly all that impressive in the playoffs. Career stats of 54.5 completion, 4900 yards, 27 TDs and 21 INTs in 22 games. Elway didnt drag anyone anywhere.So, the point you were trying to make is wrong on both accounts.1. There was plenty if talent on Elways SB teams. At the very least he was working with more than Marino was.2. His performances were not good enough to drag the teams anywhere.
fo43u97	1587497732	Patriots	nfl	
fo43uw2	1587497741	Rams	nfl	I wouldnt be at all surprised to be division champs and win a couple playoff games.I wouldnt be at all surprised to be 412 and see the offense regress.As long as we arent 88
fo43v2b	1587497743	Bills	nfl	Not really your fault, pretty sure there was a post on here with the title saying what you said and I didnt see any corrections calling the title misleading in the comments.
fo43un0	1587497737	Cardinals	nfl	No, not necessarily, Kinlaw has some significant medical issues that didnt come out then.
fo43v58	1587497744	Patriots	team	Anyone, ANYONE who thinks this I will fist fight to the death. He has a steep dead cap, it is MORONIC for that case alone  beyond it, the guy is worth his weight and is the best corner in the league. A 1st round draft pick is as any other picks, a crapshoot.
fo43v95	1587497746	Ravens	nfl	Thats the kind of thing Im hoping for.
fo43vcl	1587497747	Eagles	team	Is there an added benefit to rolling over? Is that 25 mil of space going to be added on top of the regular cap ceiling?I guess Im just confused why expiring contracts or one year deals arent treated or viewed the same way as the rollover money you are describing like they would be in the NBA.
fo43v5f	1587497744	Jets	nfl	Its a shame the broncos and bears cant seem to use the color scheme right.
fo43va5	1587497746	Eagles	team	Id take Ruggs or Murray. I really hope we take Murray though
fo43vud	1587497753	Lions	team	I was having this debate with a friend  who do you think would improve the Lions defense more, Chaisson or Kinlaw? Obviously ones an edge and the other is an interior guy, but Kinlaw had the potential to collapse pockets on the interior. Couldwould be wreak more havoc up the middle than Chaisson would off the edge? I know the thread is specifying edge rushers, but I think ultimately we need pass rushers. Whether thats off the edge or up the middle. So I want to throw Kinlaw into the discussion.
fo43vk9	1587497750	Lions	nfl	The protestors can be the canary in the coal mine. If they dont get sick, then maybe the worst has passed.
fo43wcr	1587497760	Browns	team	I think the teams liking himno negative words is just talking about his character, not necessarily his ability on the field.
fo43w2t	1587497756	Giants	team	You can only have so many on the field and we are 4 quality starters deep at the position in a 34
fo43w54	1587497757	Cowboys	nfl	My favorite one is against the Skins DB. The others are all reactionary, but this one he set him up good.
fo43w93	1587497759	Jaguars	team	Until Wednesday nightThursday morning mocks are just for clicks. Thats it.
fo43war	1587497759	Cowboys	team	The ending to that game has like 68 HOLY SHIT! moments.
fo43w47	1587497757	Vikings	team	I like Lamar a lot and he won me 2 fantasy titles this last year....buuuuut lets hold off on putting him in the same category as Mahomes just yet. If Lamar does it again next year then I think he may belong in that category. But Mahomes is just on a whole another level than any other QB in the league, young or old. (IMO)
fo43w5c	1587497758	Vikings	nfl	Thank you, unfl
fo43wkb	1587497763	Texans	team	So no 2nd rounders on this site?See you in 2022.
fo43wwd	1587497768	49ers	team	I enjoyed Lamichael Pettway out of Iowa State this past season. I honestly couldnt tell you who is NFL talent and who isnt,  but i was disappointed to see he will likely go undrafted. Was pretty clutch, made some huge plays. Always got the ball. Not even sure why i watched so much cyclone football this year....
fo43wwo	1587497768	49ers	nfl	I mean, in scenario one, theyll still spread it to innocent people if they do in fact catch it.
fo43x3r	1587497771	Cowboys	nfl	Well, if there are no games then outside of the guaranteed money, the franchises dont have to pay anything.
fo43xxj	1587497783	Texans	nfl	RE STOP REPLYING TO ALL
fo43y2d	1587497784	Rams	team	Am I the only one who thinks these arent that good?The huge bolt on the shoulders and number on the helmet all look kinda tacky to me.
fo43xtd	1587497781	Bengals	team	Ive been digging the Tony Romo comp, seems pretty apt for playing style but hopefully not for playoff performance
fo43y8e	1587497787	Bengals	team	Also, it would be a shit ton of money for a very average receiver.
fo43y3z	1587497785	Seahawks	team	What movie just ends with over half the story untold?
fo43y6d	1587497786	Seahawks	nfl	FUCK ME THESE ARE SICK!!
fo43y8d	1587497787	Vikings	nfl	
fo43yec	1587497789	Cowboys	nfl	I remember the 50 boys vs 50 pats. That was my very first cowboys game I watched after coming to the US
fo43yj3	1587497791	Chargers	team	Not a huge fan tbh, prefer our old jerseys
fo43yhu	1587497791	Browns	team	Yeah, thats just not a firstround guy to me. LBs have to be able to defend the pass first now.
fo43ywy	1587497796	Cowboys	nfl	my main point is that assuming you had a healthy romo, there is no way you could say romo wasnt the better player. a good head coach and front office should choose to put the better player on the field as that gives you the best chance to win. hot handmomentum is a dumb concept that really doesnt translate to wins and the fact they wouldnt let romo and dak have a competition when romo was healthy again proves to me thats sheer incompetence from jerry and co. dak didnt beat out romo in training camp like brady did vs bledsoe nor did romo start playing like shit and get benched a la bledso for romo. it was an injury and you should test to see who plays better when he is healthy.
fo43z93	1587497801	Packers	team	aw, this must be hard on you
fo43zcx	1587497802	Vikings	team	We absolutely decimated the Saints in both 2017 and 2019, followed by losing nail biters to the Eagles and 49ers. Thats just facts. After the Vikings roamed through, New Orleans was somehow even less livable than it was before, due to the path of carnage we created.
fo43zhh	1587497804	Dolphins	team	Bullshit, hes not even 3.
fo43zic	1587497804	Vikings	nfl	A meniscus means nothing, this report is silly
fo43zjd	1587497804	49ers	nfl	I had a lovely drive up through the county. I wanted to keep going
fo43zkn	1587497805	Lions	team	Sure, but if they trade with us, the risk someone else jumping them to grab Tua.
fo43zm3	1587497805	Browns	team	Youre doing your part and thats awesome. Cheers to you!
fo43zrk	1587497807	Redskins	nfl	Im 100 on the Chase Young train.  Dont overthink it, just get a great player.  Also theyre just not going to get a good enough offer (e.g. 3 first rounders, plus more picks) in exchange for the 2 spot, since Tua is far from a sure bet at this point.       Id love to see them trade down from 66, depending on who is there.      I would also not be surprised to see them draft a LB in the 3rd round, despite the needs at TE and WR.  Rivera and Del Rio love LBs, and if theres a good one there I think theyll take one.  They want to start a culture and have a good player who will develop in their system and learn from a guy like Thomas Davis.
fo43zuf	1587497809	Jets	nfl	Lol just wait until you see Sam with an offense around him
fo43zuz	1587497809	Raiders	nfl	are u still upset about that game
fo43zow	1587497806	Ravens	nfl	He was absolutely electrifying. Perfect fit for the chargers.
fo440de	1587497816	Broncos	team	So all you want is the D? wink wink
fo440ik	1587497818	Eagles	nfl	This argument is not from emotion. All of your points so far have been invalidunrelated to your initial opinion.
fo440kc	1587497819	Browns	team	There was an interesting mock on rnfldraft that had us trading back, taking kinlaw, the  ezra cleveland next, then ashtyn davis. I dont hate it.

fo4409i	1587497814	Patriots	team	100 agree
fo440bi	1587497815	Broncos	team	Thats because ours were not ass to begin with... and ours are still better than some of the reworks.
fo4413y	1587497826	Eagles	team	thank you. I moved out of the area and everyone assumes Im a penn state fan. I always ask them if they are fans of  (insert pro team or city that is 4 hours away) and they dont get the sarcasm at all
fo440z7	1587497824	Eagles	team	Its just ridiculous calling someone bitchmade for being scared of Philly at first. Its not like I agree with the people youre replying to Philly isnt actually scary. Hes not right about that. But the kid is from bumfuck Texas the fact that he was scared doesnt make him a bitch. Put a Philly kid in the middle of nowhere west Texas and theyd probably find it scary at first too, even though its anything but. I wouldnt call them a bitch for that either.
fo4418f	1587497827	Colts	nfl	Its not just him. The majority of our corners come from pressman backgrounds and would also benefit from a scheme change.
fo441fw	1587497830	Eagles	team	Zero point zero percent chance the 97.5 update girl has any legit sources, especially about medicals of a top prospect

fo442ir	1587497845	Chargers	team	Code worked! Thanks! White Bosa jersey is locked and loaded.
fo442kd	1587497845	Falcons	team	Fuck that mentality. You know we pay taxes to cover our asses in situations like this. How about we get some of our fucking money back not just 1200 and we prevent bills from being collected. The banks will survive. The economy is goign to get a lot worse if we have to shut down again and if more people die.
fo442xh	1587497850	Dolphins	team	LMFAO hell no!
fo442zp	1587497850	Cowboys	nfl	Carter had his moments and Testeverde and Bledsoe were veteran leaders that the super young team needed in the early 2000s.  But yeah, the rest were spares.
fo4434y	1587497852	Bengals	nfl	Maybe Carsons knee, but we put together some great teams with horrible luck
fo443l9	1587497859	Chargers	nfl	Lmfao
fo443lj	1587497859	Chargers	team	Liz Lemon does football?
fo443mn	1587497859	Browns	nfl	yea i hate that
fo443it	1587497858	Lions	nfl	What the fuck Steve, how the did we accidentally draft Anthony Gordon third overall?
fo4443t	1587497866	Lions	nfl	Body built by Taco Bell.
fo444h1	1587497870	Browns	team	Probably, he is a great person and I love his story, so awesome. But hes not a great prospect in my eyes.
fo444j1	1587497871	Broncos	nfl	The other problem with that situation is that it looks bad to other free agents and will make the skins have to overpay if they want someone in particular.
fo444ng	1587497873	Chiefs	team	Can we point how how lowkey savage it was that they tagged him on Twitter when announcing it? Fucking glorious.
fo444dw	1587497870	Chiefs	team	I wouldnt go so far as to say the full audio proves anything one way or the other, but its definitely not the situation that was painted by the VERY heavilyedited leak. They speak briefly about the 2014 incident in the full audio but its hardly enough to constitute evidence one way or the other.
fo444xf	1587497876	Lions	team	Because not hitting up the redskins would be dumb from a trade standpoint. Hitting them up gives you a worst case bargaining point for the Lions and if youre in love with Tua youre not going to be blindsided by someone else just saying fuck it and giving a haul to the redskins
fo4457d	1587497880	Vikings	team	Well their franchise is ran by Dan Snyder so.....Its hilarious to me the people who thought (or maybe still think?) Alex Smith, if healthy, would have been better than Kirk Cousins lol. Or Case Keenum for that matter.
fo444k4	1587497872	Jaguars	team	Doesnt make sense. We all know Caldwell only uses the discord and we all know Flounder doesnt talk on there.
fo444zh	1587497877	Broncos	team	Okay those are sweet looking
fo445kr	1587497885	Vikings	team	Ricks word is bond.
fo445l3	1587497885	Redskins	team	Lions want him if he is there at 3. Small chance
fo445sy	1587497888	Texans	team	Yea, maybe its different in other cities or age groups. I havent seen that a whole lot in Austin personally.
fo445i1	1587497884	Ravens	team	we have 57 players signed, and not 57 roster spots available, no?
fo445m5	1587497885	Titans	team	Tony Loves wrestling and his fathers money Khan
fo445ln	1587497885	Broncos	team	Lmao omg I struggled so hard with structuring my sentence so I wouldnt say that haha but its inevitable. YES give me the old D!
fo445zr	1587497891	Raiders	team	I feel like we are going to try to get Jeudy or lamb with our first pick. I think we are most likely going to trade back with the 19th pick to get more picks. I wouldnt mind if we traded back twice with the 19th pick.
fo44685	1587497893	Packers	team	All in all, SF was just a horrific matchup for us.  I hate to put our success on the back of anothers failure, but if anyone had knocked them out we wouldve likely been in the Superbowl since we matched up with everyone else much better.
fo446f6	1587497896	Raiders	team	We need a WR and Lamb is the best...
fo446ao	1587497894	Eagles	nfl	come to butthead
fo446ey	1587497896	Vikings	team	christomasson(httpswww.twitter.comchristomasson) (Chris Tomasson) Vikings GM Rick Spielman said he would feel confident drafting a WR beyond the first round who could plug in and play. He said even in the fourth and fifth round there are guys they could get at WR that could make immediate contributions.I am a bot lubricated by Ricks slickness  message me(httpswww.reddit.commessagecompose?toFleetFlotTheTweetBot)  source code(httpsgithub.comJohnMTorgersonFleetFlotTheTweetBot)  Skl!
fo446gu	1587497897	Raiders	nfl	If the Broncos went back to the Orange Crush unis or something similar it would be no contest. As it stands they look like arena football uniforms.
fo446ts	1587497901	Ravens	team	While I love Murray and Terrell in the 2nd (neither is dropping that far) Id be a little sad if we passed on Jefferson.
fo446u8	1587497901	Ravens	team	Yes thats correct.
fo447kk	1587497911	Vikings	team	I literally proved that Murray, Rivers and Mayfield were worse lol. They are OBJECTIVELY worse qbs, and your opinion is wrong when it comes to that. You also were wrong about the most of the FA qbs being better statement as well, but you actually owned up to that. I do apologize for being condescending, butyou have taken zero responsibility for the outlandish, and wrong claims youve made. Im not arguing your opinion, Im arguing the portions where you are wrong, and youre digging your heels in regarding that. Your opinion that we can replace a top10 qb like its nothing is your opinion, and one that I asked multiple times for you to explain (to no avail, which is fine). That isnt something Im arguing, because its an actual opinion, regardless of whether or not I agree with it.
fo447e5	1587497909	Jaguars	nfl	But its their grandmas recipe! You have to know her entire genealogy and life story to understand it!
fo447sf	1587497914	Colts	team	Eason is your prototypical NFL prostyle offense college QB. Can throw the ball a mile, but has issue with accuracy and decision making at times. Its a big part of why Fromm, who is NOT a prototypical NFL QB(his arm strength is more on par with Russell Wilson, but with less mobility) kept the starting job at UGA after Eason recovered from his injury. Hurts is a high riskhigh reward guy. Best NFL comparison is Jameis Winston with better leadership traits. He has a good arm and can run, but I feel like he tends to tuck and run a little too much. Definitely benefited from playing subpar defenses in the Big 12 last season. Struggled a little v SEC defenses(LSU, first half vs UGA). Upgrade over Jacoby in he has more confidence.Id rather have Eason than Hurts. He fits the role in Reichs offense better, and I feel like Hurts will give up a bit too much behind our line. Eason can move when needed, Hurts will move when unnecessary.
fo4485z	1587497919	Falcons	team	Florida man caught working out in closed Tampa park.     Tom had to do it to gain his Florida citizenship
fo447v9	1587497915	Patriots	nfl	Now thats a nice fuckin jersey right there.
fo447y8	1587497916	Rams	team	I have the ram head as my phones background, just so I can wake up to it and see it all the time, just hoping I may soon love it  Its been about a month and I am regressing to hating the logo. The damn horns are the worst, its a banana with gradient. Im not going to even try to like the LA logo, that shits a mess.I have no faith in the unis. Ready to pop money on the throwbacks once the new ones are release.
fo4489g	1587497920	Browns	nfl	anyone tried cracker barrel mac and cheese any good?
fo447jz	1587497911	Eagles	team	Yeah I dont know what to make of it. Its weird to me when a guy like this is an undisputed 1st round talent but yet simultaneously everyone criticized how hes only a slot receiver, his skill set is redundant, etc...like, how can this guy be such a highly touted prospect yet also be aJason Avant ceiling. If we trade down and get conventional X receiver like reagor or Mims I get it...but if the dudes a baller and a 1st round level receiver, who cares what his skill set suggests. IMO you get an elite playmaker and you make it work no matter what your personnel is. The whole draft for scheme fit thing only makes sense in later rounds for me.
fo447w2	1587497915	Panthers	nfl	Again, missing the point and dodging my question. How many QBs in league history do you think would he leading the Panthers in passing and rushing TDs given they played the same amount of time as Cam Newton?
fo447z5	1587497917	Patriots	team	Most people would be shocked how often the plot of land a house sits on is worth more than the building itself.
fo4483y	1587497918	Raiders	team	Pass. I dont want to give up any draft capitol to move up. I want to move down at some point and gain some.
fo44845	1587497919	Steelers	team	Uh, what?
fo4486m	1587497919	Steelers	team	Farrior, Foote, Keisel, Peezy .. Troy and Ike in the backfield, I miss that defense
fo448mk	1587497926	Falcons	nfl	1 Numbers are the side of the helmet are always hideous and should never exist.2 Thunderbolts on pants looks like something a child would come up with. It is an extremely generic idea. Just because it doesnt exist in the NFL anywhere else doesnt mean it isnt boring.
fo448z5	1587497930	Jets	team	Remember when bumass Schefter said Darnold may have stayed in college if we had the top pick?
fo4498b	1587497934	Dolphins	nfl	Agreed.
fo448vg	1587497929	Colts	team	Went a little rogue there at the end but well done. Well call you.
fo449b3	1587497935	Chargers	team	Powders blues with YELLOW PANTS, absolute best combo and such a great nod to our throwbacks. Now the question is Bosa or DJ33 jersey?
fo449eq	1587497936	Bears	team	I really like Prince, but I think hell be a liability the older he gets.
fo449ir	1587497938	Raiders	team	I agree with you that this article is wack, but disagree with take a WR at 12 I think the best thing to do would trade out if it using one of those top 3 WR to get more value. I think the 2nd tier of WR like Mims, and Higgins are just as good as the Top 3 without the hype, we get our WR (Mims for example) at 19. Though if we stayed at 12 Im right with you Lamb or Ruggs would be awesome.
fo449jq	1587497938	Broncos	team	The thing you might not understand is once a Bronco then you fam for life. F all the rest
fo449yr	1587497944	Broncos	team	Sorry John! I didnt have time to call in our draft pick, I was trying to decide between Awesome Orange and Asskicker Blue.
fo449xv	1587497943	Dolphins	team	because they feel super strong about one of those 4?
fo449zg	1587497944	Lions	team	The problem is that with all the changes to operation this year, it may be difficult to pull off a trade during the draft. If they can have the outline of the deal prepared already and then make it official after Young is drafted, they can pull it off. But it seems like people are worried that it might be difficult to accomplish a trade this year.
fo44ad9	1587497949	Jets	team	This changes nothing. Im sure he wants to keep him but if the right deal comes along he would probably trade him. He said he loves Jamal but would listen to any offer that a team had. Which is his job.
fo44a9j	1587497948	Giants	nfl	you think thats a lot of karma? just make a joke about kelvin benjamin being fat and you will have more upvotes than you can spend in 10 lifetimes!
fo44ahr	1587497951	Packers	nfl	Thats much higher return than hes worth.Bulaga who has played at a top level but with nagging injuries just walked and signed for the same deal Ereck Flowers just got.Trent is almost not even worth a 2nd rounder anymore.
fo44am5	1587497953	Ravens	nfl	That score seems more like. Dolphins Ravens game
fo44aaq	1587497948	Broncos	team	sugar daddy Mr. Elway has joined the chat lmao
fo44afx	1587497950	Vikings	nfl	Hes going to wind up getting 2 mega contracts because he was drafted before he was 21.
fo44b5k	1587497960	Rams	team	How are you getting downvoted for saying you arent a fan of ANOTHER TEAMS branding??Either chargers fans are here downvoting anything slightly negative, or weve lost our priorities.
fo44b0v	1587497958	Colts	team	Malik Hookers twitter is full of Colts stuff, including the header. If he was trying to make a statement with social media, I doubt hed just leave everything up there.Also, I feel like every time people read into this type of stuff ...its wrong.
fo44bf3	1587497964	Dolphins	team	the reaction around here if that were to happen would be quite fascinating.
fo44bme	1587497966	Chargers	team	Yeah thats when mine says... but I also ordered like 4 other things. 2 hats and another jersey. 
fo44bsg	1587497968	Texans	team	Good possibility as well
fo44brs	1587497968	Vikings	nfl	Christ dude, this is a shit tier take
fo44bsn	1587497969	Browns	team	I dont see a scenario where Okudah falls to 10 but I would agree if hes there its clearly BPA. I dont see how OkudahWard would not be INSANE. Im pretty stuck heading into the draft where its Simmons at 10 if hes there and then go get Trent Williams. If Simmons isnt there I look at trading down to a few spots and taking your tackle of choice.
fo44by4	1587497970	Buccaneers	team	thats super interesting. raises further questions for me. Do teams really care about getting fined? Like if Brady hits all his incentives we probably had a very good season, so would the Glazers really care about a fine if we win the SB?
fo44chs	1587497978	Chargers	nfl	Im a Chargers, Jazz, and Red Sox fan. Dont ask. Lol
fo44bu4	1587497969	Broncos	team	What didnt age well?
fo44bxg	1587497970	Jaguars	nfl	Im thinking a solid 511 to possible 88.

fo44c6o	1587497974	Eagles	nfl	Cadillac was the truth his rookie year!Also, dont forget Ronnie Brown was the 2 pick that same draft, also from Auburn. I doubt we ever see two RBs from the same college team both drafted in the first round the same year again, let alone both going in the top 5.
fo44cll	1587497979	Patriots	nfl	Second round CBs
fo44cd9	1587497976	Vikings	team	AntiPackers
fo44czw	1587497985	Packers	team	Def gonna have to trade up if we want Jefferson
fo44d1b	1587497985	Colts	team	If we got him, Id be happy. But Eason fits Reichs offense better, he can move when needed, and Hurts got some inflated numbers playing in a weak defensive conference last season.
fo44d6m	1587497987	Panthers	nfl	I support this only because my biggest fear is they put Christian McCaffrey on the cover.
fo44d8z	1587497988	Vikings	team	Got himself a silver award!
fo44d9n	1587497989	Jaguars	nfl	Yep. Innocent people will get it, some of them will suffer and die because of these asshole protesters
fo44d6v	1587497988	Packers	nfl	He never deserved the factory of sadness that is Cleveland
fo44ddq	1587497990	Seahawks	team	There are good runningbacks in that list, dont tell me they wouldnt have done better than Homer. Devin Singletary looked like a beast, Alexander Mattison literally looked like the Beast, Miles Sanders is a backup but showed out when he got opportunities, Tony Pollard had over 5 yards per carry, and Josh Jacobs carries his team to a 79 record, which is 7 more wins than Travis Homer would have been able to carry a team to.They ABSOLUTELY would have made a difference.
fo44dh9	1587497992	Chargers	team	Woodie!
fo44djf	1587497992	Chargers	team	Yeah the navys would be more fire imo with gold bolts, powder blue outline and navy helmet but its cool they are sick.
fo44dg6	1587497991	Patriots	nfl	WR
fo44dnc	1587497994	Patriots	nfl	Right on thanks for getting back to me!
fo44dvt	1587497997	Falcons	nfl	Isnt every other new jersey from this years batch just a throwback or colour rush version. Atleast we got new unis
fo44do6	1587497995	Bengals	team	I just looked up what it would be and youre right. I doubt they pick it up. Also I just realized that the 11th pick is potentially more valuable than the 10th pick because of how the option works
fo44dr3	1587497996	Broncos	team	Oh wow whys there a black couch.
fo44dxm	1587497998	Packers	nfl	After doing a project about him, I think its safe to say James Harden is good at basketball.
fo44dyq	1587497998	Saints	nfl	Where in MD? Im going to move back home soon
fo44eb3	1587498003	Jets	team	If were assuming that their play this year will match their play last year, then yeah.  Edoga and Fant both have more potential than Beachum though.  We do need to draft one at 11 if available though.  We definitely agree on that.
fo44ebo	1587498004	Steelers	nfl	If the Bengals ever figured their shit out I think the AFC North would be pretty good looking. Id like to see their color rush jerseys with a white helmet incorporated more once the helmet rule is changed.
fo44e43	1587498001	49ers	nfl	WR minus Deebo last year
fo44eg8	1587498006	Seahawks	nfl	interestingone of the reasons it gets better at restaurants is that they cook over industrial burners so it gets hotter faster and then they can take it off the heat, preserving moisture in the food. if you wanna get really into it, you can get a cheap propane cast iron wok burner and a steel wok and cook it outside, thats what we do.
fo44ekk	1587498007	Lions	nfl	We havent had a consistent feature RB since Barry Sanders
fo44ee9	1587498005	Patriots	team	At 23, I think we should focus on the front 7. Queen, Murray, GrossMatos, Epenesa or Chassion (he may be off the board by then).We could also trade back into the second and we could be in range for Baun. I think we definitely need to draft at least two receiving threats whether it be WR or TE. As I said to a few friends of mine, I might flip a table if day 2 passes and we havent drafted at least one pass catcher. A day 3 guy that I think may be available is Quez Watkins from Southern Miss. 6 foot burner who runs a 4.35 and can also compete for jump balls. Well probably take a flier on a QB in the later rounds too if not earlier.Then again, I never have a clue what to surefire expect from Belichick aside from a DB in the second (even though we dont have one this year... yet)
fo44ehq	1587498006	Dolphins	team	Fascinating is one way to put it.
fo44ehv	1587498006	Giants	team	Im skeptical of burrow just because he came out of nowhere. That LSU team was so good they probably win a natty even without him at QB. With that being said, he did look good against good teams in the best conference in college. He absolutely torched some of the best schools in football.
fo44ej1	1587498007	Cowboys	team	Severely underrated for what he was able to do behind below average olines throughout his career
fo44ep1	1587498009	Cardinals	nfl	The numbers on the sides of the helmet makes it look pretty cheesy, otherwise theyre pretty dope
fo44ezm	1587498013	Cowboys	nfl	Yeah its weird how there are many QBs, especially now, that are far more athletic than he was, but they couldnt come close to his elusiveness.
fo44fa1	1587498017	Vikings	team	Good shit Rick. Dont waste those early picks.
fo44fay	1587498017	Packers	nfl	The GMs are seriously going to do this from their homes?   Im pretty damn sure I would be at a location with redundant internet connections and providers if I were them.
fo44feh	1587498019	Vikings	team	Is WR unique in that regard?Vikings GM Rick Spielman said he would feel confident drafting a WRDTGSDECBTE beyond the first round who could plug in and play. He said even in the fourth and fifth round there are guys they could get at WRDTGSDECBTE that could make immediate contributions
fo44fga	1587498019	Giants	nfl	Thats not true at all.  A meniscus means I cant fit any more bourbon in this glass, and that says a lot.
fo44gaf	1587498031	Falcons	team	My exact thoughts everytime someone on face book screams about how we need to go back to work. No, we need to live in a society that cares enough about its people that we CAN stay home for a month and stop a deadly virus from spreading without everyone going broke.

fo44h9v	1587498044	Eagles	team	The photoshop is so bad that he could have told me he was petting the thing and I would have bought it.
fo44hko	1587498048	Jets	nfl	Yea true, but I think others have touched upon this, even if it was a conference call on a landline Id still have someone stationed outside ready to go in case of an emergency considering theyre making multimillion dollar decisons. Theyll never regret having him there and never using him, they would regret not having him there and needing him, you know?
fo44ht9	1587498052	Dolphins	nfl	No need to raise your voice
fo44h9n	1587498044	Cowboys	team	Theres a burden you bear as the most popular, most valuable team. The team that all the networks want in primetime games. The team that all of the talking head sports programs are talking about on a nationwide platform. Because the Cowboys last championship was in 1995, a lot of people think all of this attention is unwarranted. They also think the idea that the Dallas Cowboys are Americas Team should be revoked or otherwise done away with. Theyre wrong. Theyre just haters.They have some points but mostly they have a constant IV drip of haterade.
fo44idi	1587498059	49ers	nfl	Dont caaaaaaaall me daughter, because I am A duuuuuuude
fo44iek	1587498060	Seahawks	team	This mans deep ball is insane. To throw a ball with that arc that drops like that, with an almost impossible velocity. Legit looks physics breaking.
fo44hza	1587498054	Titans	nfl	There was one year (2006 or 2007?) where the Titans wore 9 different combinations lol it was ridiculous but fun
fo44iaj	1587498058	Redskins	nfl	Exact same injury, in the exact same spot on the field. Spooky shit.
fo44ig2	1587498060	Redskins	nfl	Its the interaction of putting the rice and the soy sauce together which doesnt work here at home.
fo44ijy	1587498061	Dolphins	team	ppl forget you can win super bowls with an elite defense and a running game while having an average QBI say we pick Isaiah Simmons 5 even if Tua is available
fo44iw8	1587498067	Buccaneers	team	Until recently, our defense has been a much bigger liability than our oline. Weve been drafting pretty well based on need, though Ill concede that OJ was a luxury pick
fo44j1p	1587498069	Jets	team	Its close, but Lamb is considered to have a lot better agility and YAC ability, and more tape coming out of the X WR spot as opposed to the slot (Jeudy lined up in the slot a lot). Additionally, Lamb is very good at being physical and surprisingly great at run blocking from what Ive seen. Jeudy does have better top end speed and outstanding route running in his favor, so its obviously close, but Lambs tool set looks closer to WR1 than Jeudy does at the moment.
fo44ikp	1587498062	Giants	team	Thats exactly how I feel. With Hal I wouldve wanted the pick with the highest floor. With a hopefully competent line coach in Colombo, give me the one with the highest ceiling.
fo44j9r	1587498071	Bears	nfl	To add on the craziness, Cedric Benson made it 3 RBs taken in the top 5 that draft.No way we ever see that happen again
fo44j3q	1587498069	Chargers	team	Really? I like the yellow pant variants on the home AND the away combo..
fo44j5t	1587498070	49ers	team	I still believe in Street.
fo44j9d	1587498071	49ers	team	Best KLB in the game
fo44jf6	1587498073	Rams	nfl	Man, Id sign up to be a Browns fan right now if wed get sports back safely.
fo44jcw	1587498073	Chargers	team	Both
fo44jya	1587498080	Eagles	nfl	She isnt. She works for a radio station that is currently getting hammered in ratings to their local rivalcompetitor. Its the same station that last week a host out out there about the eagles covering lamb. There is absolutely no chance she has a source with medicals on Jeudy. Its a move to drive up listenership
fo44jj9	1587498075	Patriots	nfl	Bradford was not better than keenum that year
fo44jta	1587498078	Redskins	team	...Chase Young  s this team too! 
fo44jws	1587498080	Giants	team	If we trade down like a spot or 2...at 4 I really think the best value is Simmons. After 4 tho take an OT I dont care, just get more picks.
fo44k5b	1587498083	Vikings	team	To be fair to them it was a weird scenario, Cousins just had the one full season starting when they had to negotiate. Still the contract they offered him considering that season was borderline insulting.
fo44k9x	1587498085	Cowboys	nfl	No sorry.
fo44kcu	1587498086	Giants	team	Its in my second paragraph.
fo44kfx	1587498087	Lions	nfl	But they can be pretty predictable in the First aside from Ragnow. Most mocks had us taking Davis and Hockenson and Decker was the best Tackle (our biggest need at the time) available at our pick.
fo44km6	1587498090	Jaguars	nfl	They know that sovereign immunity is a thing. Nothing but posturing for the base in an election year
fo44kdy	1587498087	Chiefs	team	Nice try Matt Moores wife
fo44kk8	1587498089	Vikings	team	Moron.
fo44km0	1587498090	Packers	team	Doesnt that make the case for my statement better?  That we were fine with most everyone else without a WR2 but when it came down to it we just didnt have the right talent on the defense because we were unlucky enough to draw SF in the championship game?
fo44kot	1587498091	Packers	nfl	Maybe, maybe not. I know NFL teams have private companies that do a shit ton more research on players. Last year on KFAN (Minneapolis sports radio) they were talking to one of the company heads who works with 1 team from each division (so 8 teams) and the testing they did was insane. Some stuff I remember is they had like a wolf (trained) or something chase them to find out some sort of instinct. Had tests for like toe strengthgrip for olinemen. Had a taser test. They would try and test them in as many time zones and altitudes as possible to find the affects those had on players. Might be harder with the whole quarantine this year but at they combine youd learn a little. Their private companies would learn what the prospect had at dinner July 18th 2009.I forget his name but he use to have a book hed publish after the draft of the info but I dont think he does anymore.
fo44l1i	1587498095	Steelers	team	When I saw who was doing it, I had higher expectations.  Mine were also under whelmed.
fo44kfh	1587498087	Redskins	nfl	When I posted on rcooking there were so many complaints about it but I never googled enough recipes to care. Now that I do it pisses me off.
fo44kfp	1587498087	49ers	team	And Street has been good when he has played too.
fo44l2s	1587498096	Browns	team	Yeah this is exactly what I did today.  They had every jersey I was looking for and they should be here early next week.  (Im in San Diego)
fo44lcb	1587498099	Panthers	nfl	Calm down, tits
fo44ldf	1587498099	Raiders	nfl	I like the Bengals unis. If anything I think the Ravens have the worst in the division, although I love their colors.
fo44lkx	1587498102	Jets	team	Thats the gamble with Beachum too
fo44lsm	1587498105	Patriots	nfl	The Tom Bradys are number 4 most playoff wins.
fo44l80	1587498098	Chiefs	nfl	doesnt drake have warriors tattoos though? permanent ink  fairweather fandom for the curse i guess
fo44lor	1587498103	Ravens	team	Didnt we miss the playoffs only twice?
fo44lxo	1587498106	Bengals	team	Its crazy how good our practice jerseys look. The helmet is the cornerstone that the uniform is built on, thats also why the chargers work. Simple design elements keeps the helmet in focus, and why I think the color rush looks amazing
fo44m0k	1587498107	Vikings	team	I love Rick.  He knows.
fo44m2i	1587498108	Browns	team	The Brownie headband is sick
fo44m78	1587498110	Chargers	team	Everyone misses woodie, no disrespect to ek.  Woodie was like sproles, but lets be honest, sproles was more talented and woodies heart was what carried him.
fo44m7u	1587498110	Dolphins	team	Id be fine with that as long as we trade the other 2 1st round picks for Watson. Otherwise, Young rots on a mediocre team similar to Wake.
fo44mmu	1587498116	Patriots	nfl	You dont think scheme and skill player matchups are correlated with accuracy?
fo44mw6	1587498119	Eagles	nfl	FFXI is my favorite hands down. Spent so much time just sitting around talk to people waiting to find a party to grind some levels. Now a days xi and even XIV are too easy imo and are worth experiencing but I havent gotten into XIV as much.
fo44mic	1587498114	Falcons	team	  Start testing everyone and it drops below a quarter of a percent.Start testing everyone and it drops to some number lower than 3, however because we dont know the exact number of carriers that percentage in unknown, and by giving ANY number, I am pulling straight out of my butthole.FTFY
fo44n4m	1587498123	Raiders	nfl	Its like got the bears jersey and said lets make this worse
fo44n9s	1587498125	Eagles	nfl	Wideout
fo44ndf	1587498126	Bills	nfl	Touche.
fo44nm4	1587498129	Patriots	team	Team is built to defeat Chiefs, got hit by injury bug and diminishing returns at QB. All is good. Ps Gilmore. Taylor. Brady. Who does Bill pick. Its not Tb12.
fo44nu1	1587498132	Falcons	team	The trade for Julio worked out pretty well. Generational talents are worth the risk.
fo44o7s	1587498137	Packers	nfl	This guys been through a Reply Allpocalypse.
fo44npf	1587498130	Cowboys	team	Came here to say this exact thing lmaoJameis Winston is THE gunslinger.
fo44oap	1587498139	Jets	team	click bait is like robo calls, it will never end
fo44ofw	1587498141	Raiders	team	See, I can agree with this. if we stay at 12, imo it has to be RuggsJeudyLamb. However youre right, if we can sell high at 12 (especially if a QB falls) and land in the mid 20s while picking up a 2nd rd I think thatd be a value move. We could still walk out with MimsReagor  TerrellDiggs in that scenario.
fo44oke	1587498142	Seahawks	team	 A team might pass a lot with play action and be doing so effectively because a team has weak pass defense.This is exactly why you need large datasets. Using only a single game, you can find support for literally any theory you want.
fo44nu5	1587498132	Giants	team	I would agree. This guy made massive improvement every year hes been in Iowa, and hes yet to reach his ceiling
fo44ogq	1587498141	Broncos	team	The numbers on the helmets just dont do it for me
fo44or8	1587498145	Falcons	team	Idk whats up with the hate, this looks sick. Might even be my new phone screensaver. Thanks for sharing
fo44onc	1587498143	Broncos	team	I think the closest you can get to a good approximation of what he wants to do here is what you can see with the 2017 Vikings.  He loves 4 WR sets with a decent mix between short curl routes and fadesverticals.  He often mixes those spread plays with play action and horizontal WR progressions.  He definitely wants to run first, expect us to run on first and 10 about 60 of the time.  Well see a lot of max protect variants which will require our WRs to block or sell blocks. He loves having max protect into a 3 WR play action.  We probably wont see a ton of motion plays, he likes being static and relying on play action to shift the formation.
fo44ozm	1587498148	Dolphins	team	Yo leave by boy X alone
fo44ovm	1587498146	Dolphins	team	Simmons and love at 18?
fo44p3x	1587498150	Broncos	team	Cody, I like many on this sub I appreciate you putting these together.In your opinion, what is the most underrated thing about Drew that the national media is missing? I see some not giving him too much respect, and I get it we only have 5 games to work off of, but to me it seemed like week to week he was getting it. Plus him reaching out to Peyton just makes me think the dude isnt taking anything for granted and knows theres things he needs to improve on.Stay safe and again thanks for all these breakdown videos. P. S. Maybe you can dissect some film on special teams for Diontae Spencer? I have a gut feeling the dude is the answer to KR and PR.
fo44p5q	1587498150	Chargers	team	439707 
fo44ppn	1587498157	Browns	nfl	oh yea God forbid you try and print it off
fo44p3f	1587498149	Packers	nfl	How bout ya boy trubisky?
fo44pk9	1587498155	Chiefs	nfl	Fr, hes exactly what Lamar is hoping not to be as far as playoff vs season performance. An all time great (regular season) QB.
fo44pti	1587498159	Eagles	nfl	I just wanted them to update the graphics, I really wish they didnt mess with the combat system
fo44pk6	1587498155	Eagles	nfl	If they bring back NFL Blitz, then Ima have to say bye bye to Madden
fo44pkx	1587498156	Vikings	nfl	He will never have to hold out because az has to pay him, thats the leverage. Why do they have to pay him? Because they would look like idiots for trading for a guy, who is requesting a pay raise, if they dont intend on handing him that raise. Thats the very reason he was traded from Houston, he says as much in the article.
fo44q07	1587498161	Rams	team	Looking at that secondary.. if theres one thing I feel very confident about, its that Les Snead can certainly identify talent for the backend of the defense.
fo44qkk	1587498169	Jets	team	All I care about is if the Pats are lousy going forward.
fo44qg6	1587498167	Lions	team	The ownership is dogshit, has been for decades
fo44qqz	1587498171	Vikings	team	mims mims mims
fo44qj5	1587498168	Packers	nfl	Ill take that punt on Thomas
fo44r1j	1587498175	Chargers	nfl	Not saying he doesnt deserve it, but what teams have the highest paid nonQB and get to the playoffs with any consistency?
fo44rd6	1587498179	Jets	team	He along with the other 3 OTs would fall in the center of this chart haha
fo44rfg	1587498180	Patriots	nfl	I see what you did there
fo44rgz	1587498180	Chiefs	team	He coaches at my high school when i was a freshman. He was always a cool guy
fo44rhb	1587498181	Cowboys	team	Since theyd be 76 throwbacks, which were for the US Bicentennial, lets do these for just the 2026 season, the Semiquincentennial. Makes sense
fo44rlf	1587498182	Broncos	nfl	Navy might be the best look but they all fireee
fo44rw7	1587498186	Giants	nfl	If there is a verifiable surgical procedure that was never disclosed, it could absolutely affect his stock regardless of how doctors felt when they examined him not having that knowledge.
fo44s7c	1587498190	Seahawks	nfl	i like it and im especially fond of creamy vs bakeddry mac. worth getting
fo44sag	1587498191	Eagles	nfl	Her being verified and twitter following has no merit on her being legit on this. She is an update girl and runs social media for the stations flagship program
fo44snp	1587498196	Dolphins	nfl	They need to get rid of all the striping on the side of there uniforms as well keep the neck the same color as the rest of the uniforms.
fo44spa	1587498196	Cardinals	team	Just Sports maybe Richards sporting goods
fo44sdk	1587498192	Packers	team	I dont remember it being that cold. I dressed as if I was going to the arctic but took off a bunch of layers and was fine.

fo44ssf	1587498198	Bears	team	Sure
fo44t2u	1587498201	Falcons	team	who knows, im not even 30 and have seen Clowney, Bosa,  the Watt brothers go through the draft. I think generational talent comes around more often than it seems.
fo44t37	1587498202	Patriots	team	KLavon Chaisson  DE, LSU. ubosoxlover12 did a great outline why, below.     My binky is AJ Dilon  RB, Boston College. I think we can get him in the 3rd round and hes every bit a poor mans Derrick Henry.
fo44t41	1587498202	Rams	team	I hate it. Ill never but any merch with the new logo. Its a total fail to me, downright embarrassing.

fo44sxf	1587498199	Buccaneers	team	Im not going to pretend like i know 100 but history would tell us teams do care. Its not like the NBA where teams go over the cap each year. I dont think the nfl has had a team over the cap in a while and when it did they got screwed. So if i had to guess, id say yeah teams care about being over the cap in the nfl.
fo44t1b	1587498201	Falcons	nfl	Again you think the tech work behind keeping a live feed going is the same as talking on the phone and I can assure you it is not
fo44t32	1587498202	Jets	team	Drafting kickers is such a crapshoot and there are league average vets that get cut from TCs every year. I would rather the Jets work the UDFA market to find one to get in camp with Maher and Ficken
fo44ti4	1587498207	Steelers	nfl	They have this white stripe on the side of the jersey that doesnt match the pants stripe and it just kills it. Theyd be a lot better just getting rid of that.
fo44tk9	1587498207	Broncos	team	How do you have the time to put out all of this content while preparing to cover the draft and producing a daily podcast?  IIRC, you also have a full time job.Not complaining, I am just impressed.  Keep up the good content!
fo44tla	1587498208	Chargers	team	That post wheel route is a good example of why Im not a big fan of him. It may well be that that route is a clean out... but he ends up being open. But doesnt have the sense to adjust from what he wanted to do pre snap to whats open now. Instead he dismisses that and throws the wrong type of ball to the wheel route and didnt give his guy a chance to make a play. And the big ben type flashes I see is when he gives up on a play too quickly and decides to go off script and usually ends up throwing an off target ball for one of his WRs. And that Auburn game...can you remember the very last play in that game?
fo44t8h	1587498203	Cowboys	team	He escapes Watt!!! Rarely ever hear that
fo44t9c	1587498204	Jets	team	Listen, you seem really upset by it, but not once in my original post did I say we were any better. Lol. I was actually pulling for the Jets back in the Sanchez days. My college roommate was a jets fan, and my second favorite team is anyone but the patriots. I hope the patriots never win a fucking game again. I think everyone is well aware of the bills struggles of the last 20 years. Im 32. At this point, I almost take pride in the years of pain and ineptitude. Its basically all I have known since Flutie left. Lol. Theres some hope right now, but Ill believe it when I see it. Still didnt stop me from going to both the Jacksonville and Houston games. Worth noting Im also the guy in the Bills sub reminding people not to sleep on the Jets. Barring some catastrophe on either side, Im assuming well split wins for the next few years. I was honestly just surprised about the divisional title thing when I found out about it. Makes sense tho. Pats had a long run, bills did in the 90s, colts did years ago, Miami back then too.

fo44v1t	1587498228	Packers	team	Because scouts pour over hundreds of hours of tape for a single prospect.  I would trust their evaluations over Rodgers who probably has seen some highlights of guys.  He probably offers some input with LaFluer like, Hey, wouldnt it be awesome if we had a guy who could do this... and LaFluer likely takes in Rodgers perspective and then relays the types of players he would like for his scheme up the Gute and the front office.Involving players can be a really touchy issue.  If you engage one player, others will start to clamor for a voice in the process and suddenly its spiraling out of control.  A lot of these guys dont have a great sense of self (none of us really do), so while its easy to say, of course, a backup would never think they have as much say as Rodgers, these guys are competitors and believe they are the best at all times.

fo44v9b	1587498230	Chiefs	nfl	No its really just a trend with action movies that began with the Bourne movies.
fo44vdq	1587498232	Bears	team	Are you just going to say no or argue the point? McMahon never passed for more than 2500 yards and had a passer rating of 80 with us
fo44vks	1587498235	Chargers	team	Haha yea I do
fo44vto	1587498238	Eagles	team	I will never root against Foles. Maybe against the team hes on, but never him in particular. Only want the best for Foles. He put us on his back and took down the GOAT. How could you ever fathom booing foles. Im sure he was half joking though.
fo44vq7	1587498237	49ers	nfl	Somebody please spice up this fucking vanilla thread please
fo44vqh	1587498237	Cowboys	nfl	draft every quarterback available and trade them for 1sts when teams lose the starters
fo44vt4	1587498238	Chargers	team	Is there a photo somewhere of that original navy blue 1960 jersey? Google images is letting me down.
fo44wba	1587498245	Panthers	nfl	No, but we can still limit their exposure to other people to slow the spread of the disease. Thats the entire point of the shelterinplace and social distancing orders. Gathering at massive events with hundredsthousands of people makes them exponentially more likely to spread germs to people like essential workers.
fo44wk6	1587498248	Rams	team	Think about all the Raider hats and car stickers you see on a regular basis in socal. They have such a strong brand presence and the logo is a significant part of that. Not only are the fans down for the team, but they enthusiastically rep the gear all the time. It adds to fan culture and enthusiasm for the team.All these edgelords who come into these threads and rant about how none of this matters and that fans care too much of the logo just dont get it.
fo44wl5	1587498248	Bears	nfl	In one of the Maddens, I think like 12 or 15, the incoming players had a trait called intangibles, which was directly correlated to how good a player would be. I dominated that league
fo44wct	1587498245	Vikings	nfl	Id be curious on the Vikings at the WR position. Treadwell and Troy Williamson were epic 1st round busts in the worst way possible. But Diggs and Theilen were great value. I dont count Moss because iI dont think it took some team great at valuing the WR position to pick him.
fo44we8	1587498246	Buccaneers	team	If he would have even just had 510 less INTs he would have got a lot more than that franchise tag.
fo44wi6	1587498247	Vikings	nfl	QBs
fo44wks	1587498248	Bills	nfl	Not necessarily. Youre basically penalizing him for Roman doing a great job at play design and game planning.
fo44wl1	1587498248	Eagles	team	Had
fo44wsf	1587498251	Falcons	team	Exception to the rule. Like APs ACL recovery.
fo44wol	1587498250	Ravens	nfl	Always gotta have faith!
fo44x3w	1587498256	Broncos	team	Not a fan of the yellow pants. The rest are nice tho.
fo44x5e	1587498256	Vikings	nfl	httpsoverthecap.comsalarycapminnesotavikings according OTC we have 12 mil with Harris on the roster right now, so i imagine yes it would it just depends on if the Vikings think hes a good scheme fit
fo44xqa	1587498264	Seahawks	team	its the same color helmet, but with different decals
fo44xeq	1587498259	Chargers	team	I think it needs the yellow facemask just for a little contrast, but either way, creamed my jeans.
fo44xf6	1587498260	Patriots	team	I like Hurts in the third. I think McDaniels can find ways to use him similarly to Taysom Hill in NOLA if he cant end up beating out Stid for QB1
fo44y3o	1587498269	Vikings	team	I said they were more talented  you did not, and literally can not, prove if they are or arent. If there was an agreed upon metric that OBJECTIVELY measured talent, then there wouldnt be any debate and the draft would be in an agreed upon, set order, every year.  I do not agree that Cousins is a top 10 QB. I do believe he is replaceable. I also honestly believe that youre an unpleasant person and I didnt come here to talk to unpleasant people that belittle me for seeing things differently than they do. Youre just some dude on reddit, man  youre not gods gift to football analysis. And, honestly, you would probably learn a lot more about football by listening to other people, even if you dont agree, instead of being an arrogant dickhead and telling them theyre thoughts and opinions are so ridiculous that they no longer qualify, in your eyes, as opinions at all.  Lets be clear about this. We obviously disagree, but neither of us have proven anything, because you cant prove opinions and you cant measure talent. Given that we have stated our opinions and they cannot be proven right or wrong, there is literally no reason for us to communicate any further.  Outside of all that  you have been an absolute asshole through most of this interaction and you really need to look up the word objective.
fo44y6f	1587498270	Giants	nfl	Yeah sure, why not. Hopefully he isnt that big of a diva though
fo44xya	1587498266	Lions	team	Im not comparing players to Chase Young.  Im simply stating there are a plenty of players taken in the Top 5 that didnt pan out to be Top 5 players.The original premise was Id rather have a boatload of picks than Chase Young.  A sentiment with which I generally agree.  Not having anything to do with Chase Young specifically, but more with the fact that EVERY player has a chance (small or large) they wont work out, even Young.Given that premise, I would rather have MORE shots than fewer.  Granted, when we say boatload of picks Im not talking about one extra 2nd or 3rd rounder, Im talking multiple Day 12 picks.
fo44ybc	1587498272	Browns	nfl	okay ima get it as a side Im going to try their chicken fried chicken iv never had it.
fo44xtx	1587498265	Falcons	team	Benkert is healthy, clipboard Matt is under contract. We dont need QB.
fo44yep	1587498273	Cowboys	nfl	Got busy at work and just now coming back to this, but I usually do to. Cant believe its being taken so well.
fo44ym7	1587498276	Jets	team	Gotta love it.  He could have gone to the Browns.
fo44yqd	1587498278	49ers	team	I was thinking it would take Dee Ford, the 13, and some late round picks, maybe a 2021 2nd rounder. Guess I was being optimistic
fo44yyn	1587498281	Raiders	team	Shelby harris as well. It was a good draft
fo44z4r	1587498283	Bills	nfl	DeShone Kizer
fo44z59	1587498283	Texans	team	No Im speaking of how it doesnt happen.  Ever.  I like how you think these QBs put winning above all else.  Watson wants to be PAID and he will be.  In fact BOB could coach for the next 10 years and if Watson is good that long I would put fat cash stacks on he would stay here.  We wont ever let him hit free agency he will get paid.  You see all the shit they talk about the Lions coach but have you 1 time heard Stafford ask to get traded? Fuck no dude is getting paid.
fo44yl4	1587498276	Patriots	team	Holy shit the people in this sub are delusional as hell. We are 100 in a rebuild. We have no offense and half a defense. Our team is completely depleted. Even if Belichick didnt want to do a rebuild, its already started because over the last few years we lost too much talent and failed to replace almost all of it.I think ideally we either extend Gilmore to make sure hes still here in a few years when we actually are able to compete again, or yeah we trade him. I dont know if a single 1st is worth trading him though over trying for a couple years to extend, though.
fo44yyc	1587498281	Browns	team	I disagree. I think when youre running a 34335 base you need one of the three LBs excellent at pass rushing and stopping the run.
fo44z25	1587498282	Bears	nfl	Im just saying, his girlfriend is like a 6, at best.
fo44z2a	1587498282	Browns	nfl	You dont like navy blue? dufaq
fo44z82	1587498284	Vikings	team	G may be one of the least important nonspecial teams players, until theyre the weakest player or unit on your team....like ours. Its a glaring need, and a position that ruined us in multiple games. If we can get Thuney for a 2nd or 3rd,I think we need to jump all over that. Instantly improves the weakest link of our offensive line (by far). Id rather have Thuney and sign him long term than taking a shot on someone like Ruiz in the 1st2nd round, and Ive been a stout proponent of drafting Ruiz.
fo44z9n	1587498285	Bears	nfl	This year, there will literally be nothing else for people to do. I think itll be the highest rated.
fo44zhe	1587498288	Bills	nfl	BoB wouldve traded him even sooner and for even less as a power move
fo44zip	1587498288	Dolphins	team	Trading up to 3 may not mean giving up the 5 spot but using other resources.
fo44zy8	1587498294	Ravens	nfl	Dolphins pass on Brees...sign Culpeper.Dolphins pass on Tua...excited to see what Rosen can do.Oof.
fo44zky	1587498289	Eagles	team	I love Philly but lets not dispute facts. With a crime rate of 40 per one thousand residents, Philadelphia has one of the highest crime rates in America compared to all communities of all sizes  from the smallest towns to the very largest cities. Ones chance of becoming a victim of either violent or property crime here is one in 25.
fo45025	1587498296	Bears	nfl	1st overall
fo44zwa	1587498293	Jets	team	IMO the defense is gonna have to figure it out and work around the weak corners. The need is too great at o line and wr. Totally cool with picking up a corner with a third or later pick.
fo450bz	1587498299	49ers	team	How about the best players?
fo44zul	1587498293	Packers	nfl	Honestly Id say first overall.
fo450xr	1587498307	Broncos	team	Too much Florida Gator for me. I appreciate the style but Im on team Navy.
fo4513v	1587498310	Chiefs	nfl	Mahomes extension how many years? total value?
fo451rf	1587498318	Falcons	nfl	Probably 1 considering the highest ever is 11 and he did not have such a power
fo451de	1587498314	Packers	team	Guys... you realize like every analyst is doing hot takes right now right? RELAX
fo451ql	1587498318	Falcons	team	Hes an inch taller and ten pounds lighter than Khalil Mack. His height isnt an issue. Hell probably put on some more weight during the offseason depending on how Quinn plans to use him. But I wouldnt consider him undersized. Either way, I think we can both agree that hes the right pick if they were to trade up.
fo451h7	1587498315	Vikings	team	He got us a 3rd or something next year too, so he still has another contribution
fo451kl	1587498316	Dolphins	team	Historically though the qbs have had quite an influence on playoff success. Obv there are the dilfers of the world but how long has it been since we had the opportunity to take a potential superstar?Simmons is a baller and i trust the front office but i think a majority of fans would like to see tua or at the very least a qb
fo451pp	1587498318	Lions	team	Rod Wood is an expert? What? I give Martha the benefit of the doubt but acting like we have football or sports management experts at the helm is a farce.
fo451vs	1587498320	Steelers	team	Wish we got to see a few years of a healthy Spence.  He looked like a middle aged linebacker moving around on the field after his recovery.
fo451wi	1587498320	Browns	team	That Baker Mayfield. So hot right now.
fo451ww	1587498320	Patriots	nfl	Hahaha virgin
fo452gg	1587498327	Ravens	nfl	I like that you switched back to the green helmets, though any jersey with large lettering above the front number is gonna look like trash.
fo452ko	1587498329	Jaguars	team	I like Anthony McFarland(I know he was injury prone) as a late round pick.When he was healthy he was very explosive
fo452bt	1587498326	Chiefs	team	Even more disrespectful to River, Carr and Lock
fo452mb	1587498329	Vikings	nfl	The people buying them arent median income. The median income people all get crammed into apartments or dated multifamily homes.
fo452p6	1587498330	Falcons	team	So, are we still happy the Falcons won this game, worsened their draft stock and are about to trade their future away to get a corner?
fo452n4	1587498330	Cowboys	nfl	I like our jerseys the best, I am biased.  Eagles need to go back to Kelly Green.Giants need to go back to GIANTS on the helmetWashingtons 70th anniversary helmets i liked but they have never had good jerseys.
fo452tn	1587498332	Raiders	nfl	Yeah a minor update would serve them well but the overall design is good IMO.
fo452zb	1587498334	Rams	team	Im getting the feeling theyre not going to hype it up at all, because they know they suck and they want to release them as low key as possible. You havent heard a peep out of the organization about the new unis. I wouldnt be surprised if they drop them Thursday morning with no heads up at all, so the backlash gets drowned out by the draft.
fo452zz	1587498335	Chargers	team	Yeah at first I was liking the blue face mask. But the more I look at the yellow the more I start to like it. I think all blue would look pretty badass. Almost like a blackout. But the contrast of the yellow is real nice.
fo45377	1587498338	Chargers	team	Well now Im just upset that the helmet strap is covering up 1.5 millimeters of the number.
fo453nr	1587498343	Jets	nfl	Also liked the kids grew apart... Not every childhood friendship lasts especially when you hit high school
fo453qe	1587498344	Falcons	team	Im glad Kemp is opening it back up but this did make me laugh
fo453qn	1587498344	Eagles	team	Alpha af
fo453ww	1587498347	Jets	nfl	Cmon, look into your heart. Wouldnt it be absolutely hilarious if Nick Saban screwed over the Dolphins again by getting them to draft Tua and he ends up as a bust or the next Sam Bradford? Much better to do that then draft the big armed tall qb who all of reddit thinks is terrible.
fo453yt	1587498347	Saints	nfl	Oh fuck you
fo4544j	1587498350	Colts	team	I say no. Change the scheme to adjust for your players strengths if you have to. Thats what Belicheck does so well each year. Why dont we?
fo45471	1587498351	Lions	team	I dont completely agree, there could be a ton of reasons to trade up including being assured the choice of the desired prospect with no outside variables other than the Bengals, the lions perhaps liking another teams offer more than the offer that this team put in, etc.
fo454aa	1587498352	Packers	nfl	WHAT THE FUCKKKK LMFAO
fo45487	1587498351	Lions	nfl	I think he might know that
fo454ds	1587498354	Ravens	nfl	Does Bama put many players into the NFL?
fo454ef	1587498354	Jets	nfl	Yall let Sanchez throw for 300 yards, idk if its the mono
fo454f9	1587498354	Cowboys	team	In many ways thats the story of his career.Quoted for truth
fo454hn	1587498355	Broncos	team	some of the best players in the nfl are choir boys lolthe biggest choir boy in our squad, justin simmons, is also one of our best players you got this twisted, elway is right on this
fo454gr	1587498355	Bears	team	Why would he get fired after we win the Superbowl with a 2quarterback formation?
fo454u2	1587498360	Eagles	nfl	SNIP SNAP SNIP SNAP GRONK!(httpstwitter.comrapsheetstatus1252684831357632518?s21)
fo45552	1587498364	Saints	nfl	Should be opposite instead of different
fo4552f	1587498363	Ravens	nfl	Fucking hell hes gonna get a seventh isnt he.
fo454tt	1587498360	Cowboys	nfl	Fuck it, is nowhere safe to you people? 
fo454z5	1587498362	Jets	nfl	HEY ASSHOLE, shut up. Were having a nice time in here.
fo455ao	1587498366	Packers	team	It was the wind. It had to be blowing at least 25mph, and it was a night game. I spent most of the pregame tailgate huddled around a charcoal bbq grill trying to keep warm.
fo455bg	1587498366	Browns	team	On the unlikelihood that those 3 stay healthy for a full season, plus we get Isaiah Simmons surely we are a high playoff team. Then again im not factoring in coaching. I mean we have about 10 really good playersHookerWilliamsClowneyChubbSimmons (should be good instantly)WardGarrettBitonioJarvisOBJHooperConklinTretter
fo455mk	1587498370	Vikings	nfl	I dont have any Scorpion Pepper hot sauce, and Reaper Pepper sauce isnt as good.
fo4555s	1587498364	Buccaneers	nfl	I dont really think that we need him on the team.
fo455ba	1587498366	Packers	team	But what about being a HoF QB, with a relatively level head, makes Rodgers a good scout of WR talent? We have a full staff of scouts watching these prospects year round, while Rodgers has at best maybe watched a bit of tape on some early round prospects. I just dont see what Rodgers has to offer them in terms of scouting.It may make more sense to consult him in Free Agency, as hes played against and watched film on guys from other teams. But not in the draft.
fo455l2	1587498370	Eagles	nfl	Lee Carvallos putting challenge.
fo455a0	1587498366	Texans	nfl	Im 100 convinced Troy Vincent leaked that shit. Supposedly he confronted McNair after the meeting.
fo455dq	1587498367	Packers	team	Gunslinger is an excellent book. Youll enjoy.
fo455ov	1587498371	Broncos	team	Certainly makes him leaving easier to deal with.
fo455up	1587498373	Patriots	team	Press X to doubt
fo455x6	1587498374	Eagles	team	It was indeed out of necessity, but the offense slogged because we were bogged down with Robert Davis, Deontay Burnett, and JJAW serving as our outside WRs and the focus was on the middle of the field. Why shouldnt we address the WR position on the outside when Alshons recover will almost certainly extend into the season (if hes even here by the start of next season), DJax will probably miss games as thats what seems to be the norm for him since hes been in the league, and JJAW hasnt shown to be remotely close to being consistent? Drafting a slot that early means overloading the middle with players with all of the same strengths and likely have similar weaknesses. That means that in 12 personnel, at least one (if not two) of Jefferson and the TEs is going to be forced into a position where theyre all in the middle of the field or one of them is working an area of the field that puts them at a disadvantage. If we had a go to guy on the outside, thats a completely different conversation, but the outside is a major point of concern both in the short term and long term and slot WRs are easier to find than outside WRs. We can take someone like Tyler Johnson in the 4th.
fo4560i	1587498376	Bills	nfl	Im really not, we have a really young team and a top 2 defense. And Im not upset at all for trading a pick in the 20s for a top 10 receiving talent on a easy to manager contract. Why would I be mad that my team got better and yours got worse?
fo4563h	1587498377	49ers	nfl	Two CBs? Clearly they hate Okudah.
fo4565c	1587498377	Eagles	nfl	Can you please elaborate on what logic you used so far in this conversation?
fo456bv	1587498380	Jets	nfl	So to recap1) Chargers2) Bucs 3) Browns 4) Patriots 5) Falcons
fo456pr	1587498385	Vikings	nfl	This time last year Andrew thomas was basically the defacto 3 player in the draft, kinda odd to see the hype die a bit on him even though nothings changed.
fo456ur	1587498387	Patriots	team	Cool but if you ever come to my restraunt Ill make sure I dont.
fo456v6	1587498388	Texans	nfl	We traded a 2nd round for Brandon Cooks and his contract. BOB defenders are saying we could just release him after a year or 2. So their defense is we traded a second round pick for a rental.
fo4571y	1587498390	Broncos	team	I just subscribed.  Lets get Cody to 10000 subscribers!
fo457fn	1587498395	Jaguars	team	I kinda see that as a positive actually  he looked like a shiftier Corey grant type to me which I love  when you get a great one they end up being an Ekeler and who wouldnt want that in your offense?
fo457nx	1587498398	Eagles	team	I would be okay with Murray. Its been years since this team has had an above average LB and I think Murray has a ton of raw talent and ability. That being said if we take Murray I want to make sure we get one of the second tier WRs  likely one of Aiyuk, Mims or Reagor. That might require trading up in the 2nd round.
fo457vy	1587498401	Ravens	team	woah...thats way more one sided than I expected.
fo457lx	1587498397	Jets	team	I guess he realized he didnt kiss his ass enough the other day.
fo4580r	1587498403	Patriots	team	Certainly not!
fo4582e	1587498404	Panthers	nfl	by any objective measure hes one of the top 56 basketball players in the league. hes also one of the most annoying basketball players to watch. I do not enjoy isolation after isolation after isolation that ends with a stepback three or Harden jumping into a defender for a foul.
fo4583v	1587498404	Texans	team	Also I think Clowney deal is bullshit to talk about.  We offered him 18 million and he said no.  Guess what he is still a FA because he isnt worth that much.  If Clowney gets a contract for more than 18 Ill take you to any Texans home game this year on me. We tried to work the deal with Clowney but he over valued himself.
fo458e9	1587498408	Redskins	team	The thought is that drafting a 3rd qb doesnt make any sense and thats it. Especially if chase young is on the board
fo4589n	1587498406	Eagles	nfl	I dont wish this on any person...but his cancer needs to hurry up.
fo458e7	1587498408	Packers	nfl	Buy me Bonestorm or go to hell!
fo458gg	1587498409	Texans	nfl	After he got traded he went to the media similar to what Hopkins just did but was still complaining about their playoff game. Odell also bashes the GM and keeps the beef going, whereas Hopkins basically kept quiet. Im sure Hop has a lot of shit he wants to say about Bob but he didnt, at least to the public, because its not worth the attention.I had a terrible game. But I left the game with seven targets, and Im supposed to be your number one receiver. I left the game with seven targets. We lost. They scored 40 points. Its just all bad. I felt disrespected, because I felt like I was a main reason at keeping that brand alive. They were getting primetime games, still, as a 5and11 team. Why? Because people want to see the show. You want to see me play.httpwww.nfl.comnewsstory0ap3000001036390articleobjfeltdisrespectedbyhowgiantshandledtrade(httpwww.nfl.comnewsstory0ap3000001036390articleobjfeltdisrespectedbyhowgiantshandledtrade)
fo458ve	1587498415	Patriots	nfl	Legend? Huh, ok.
fo45941	1587498418	Bears	team	Definitely
fo458kv	1587498411	Lions	team	Ive been thinking this all week. I just auto assumed it would be defense and didnt watch any tape on thr O tackles.. i put it on Worfs and was all in. You just dont get the opportunity to get a guy like that often. Teams font let franchise LTs into FA market like they do CBs every year. And thats what Quinn has been saying all along...take advantage of a spot in the draft he never expects to be in ever again.DECKER Dahlwiggins  Ragnow Guy from philly WirfsThink we also take a later round guard this year to develop.Next yearWirfs new guy ragnow new guy guy from philly
fo458ym	1587498416	Lions	team	Guys, what do that mean?
fo458yr	1587498416	Cowboys	nfl	Nice unis, but I believe the bolt should ALWAYS be yellow. No exceptions. My only criticism.
fo458zq	1587498417	Packers	team	I wouldnt call making roster moves as a result of what happened in two games (against one team) just to try to match up well against that one team a good strategy. It may have exposed a weakness, but do you think Pettine hasnt been obsessing over that game all offseason already?
fo459gv	1587498423	Broncos	team	Thank you! I think the national media for the majority just watched the stat sheet. He made noticeably better decisions week to week. Went to reading defenses. Hes smart as hell. Hes just got to take it week to week in 2020 and tune out the noise!! Ill be happy to look at that for Spencer too!
fo459md	1587498425	Chargers	nfl	Why did you choose us of all the teams? Thats miserable
fo459o3	1587498425	Giants	team	I considered secondthird tier OTs and also day 23 EDGE prospects but I think this works better with a small number of names
fo459oq	1587498426	Patriots	team	Yeah but like Studham, bro. Fuck having receivers and tight ends
fo459uk	1587498428	Jets	team	Damn we never brought back Lach did we? I will miss him, good punter, reliable.
fo459cf	1587498421	Jaguars	team	Boom ,done. Lets go home.
fo459f6	1587498422	Broncos	nfl	Cb Dee Virgin vs Chad CD Lamb would be an epic battle.
fo459gr	1587498423	Dolphins	team	Maybe because we arent going for an OT
fo459lf	1587498425	Titans	nfl	The colts just have had our number for 2 decades now. Fuck manning. Fuck luck
fo459om	1587498426	Patriots	team	Gronks rights for a 2 or a 3.
fo459vd	1587498428	Jets	team	Yep. And this mouth service is also a part of that. Him publicly talking Jamal up this frequently lets other GMs know the value we place on him. So if we ever get a deal for Jamal, it would be something like two first and a fourth or a comparable player and a first, which we should have to consider.
fo45a5k	1587498432	Redskins	team	Someone in this sub has been saying this for weeks. Id give him credit if I remembered who it was.
fo45a9g	1587498433	Texans	team	Were not too picky about it this year ()
fo45acn	1587498435	Lions	team	Dead as fuck lol
fo45acx	1587498435	Patriots	team	Thatll be 1 OJ Howard please
fo45ah7	1587498436	Buccaneers	team	Yep. In. Dont care about all the obvious red flags about it. Its Gronk.
fo45ak1	1587498437	Bears	nfl	Hes a legend in this town for the wrong reasons

fo45a7j	1587498433	Jets	nfl	Dumb
fo45ac5	1587498434	Broncos	team	Thanks my man!!
fo45ahm	1587498436	Vikings	team	They were doing him dirty for those last, what 3 years I believe? Just kept franchise tagging him instead of actually extending him. So on the one hand, the cost of the franchise tag is pretty high and I believe he made around 30 mil each year. But on the other hand, he had no guarantees, which is a shit way to play. Knowing you could get injured at any time and youre not technically under contract for future seasons. Skins just continually make bad decisions. Snyder is a huge idiot. Ill laugh if the draft happens and Trent Williams is still on their team.
fo45aud	1587498441	Raiders	nfl	I wouldnt call Romos injuries catastrophic, since he was still able to play at the end of his career. He just chose not to and went into broadcasting instead.Theismann had a careerending injury. The person saying Alex Smith is right, though. Similar injuries, too.
fo45aka	1587498437	Jets	nfl	Those Chargers Updated AllWhite Unis are sweeeeet
fo45azr	1587498443	Colts	nfl	While I agree it was bigger than it was. Hearing those comments in terms of the protest, do you understand why his words would have an impact on his players?
fo45b0d	1587498443	Vikings	team	Im not a betting man, but if I were Id put 5,000 on this. Maybe this is why Im not a betting man
fo45b37	1587498444	Chargers	team	Honestly that Away set might be my favorite. Love the powder blue numbers and bolt colors.
fo45b50	1587498445	Packers	nfl	If this shit happens....
fo45aul	1587498441	Bengals	team	Geno a real one

fo45b3o	1587498444	Lions	nfl	Lmao no fucking way is that Gronk for Howard shit that was going around last week gonna happen
fo45bv3	1587498454	Falcons	team	I made a black Gurley one. Its fun to design
fo45bmd	1587498451	Giants	nfl	Gronk literally from the top rope
fo45bjx	1587498451	Redskins	team	Theyd be stupid not to listen to offers, but theyd be dumber to take the offers.
fo45bn5	1587498452	Seahawks	team	And Bruce now! )
fo45c72	1587498459	Patriots	nfl	I mean, obviously those Patriots uniforms will be associated forever with Brady and that era.But they were introduced in a year when Bledsoe was the noquestion franchise QB and Bradys entire contribution as a 3rdstringer was going 13 for 6 yards in the last drive of a 349 loss for a 38 team.In any case, the thing being highlighted here is that Rivers was the first, last, and only QB to get a start in that iteration of Chargers unis, a claim that cant be made by any other QBs I can think of. Brady was the last  and far and away the most prevalent, of course  but he was neither the first nor the only.
fo45c90	1587498459	Browns	team	And I think you need all LBs capable of coverage
fo45c84	1587498459	Seahawks	nfl	48787 yards is 27.7 miles. More than a marathon worth of passing yards.
fo45clt	1587498464	Cardinals	team	Didnt Becton pop hot on a drug test?
fo45csn	1587498467	Steelers	nfl	This offseason is fucking wild
fo45ce0	1587498461	Giants	nfl	Narratora voice but he couldnt make that happen
fo45ck6	1587498464	Chargers	team	Agreed. Not sure if the stream was behind for me, but there was a commercial that started right at 645AM and ran for a few minutes so just found out about it on Instagram lol
fo45cuk	1587498467	Chargers	team	Too many people are sleeping on this because of the Home and Away ones but this is the real Gem
fo45ct6	1587498467	Patriots	team	If hes not here with us, then catching TDs from Brady is the only other place Id rather see him
fo45csx	1587498467	Chargers	team	easily the best for my personal tastes. all of them are great but this is the most aesthetically pleasing to me
fo45d3w	1587498471	Buccaneers	team	WOWWW
fo45d5y	1587498472	49ers	nfl	And let this be a lesson kidsYour memes are NOT just dreams.
fo45d7r	1587498472	Ravens	nfl	CB Dee Virgin vs the Chad CBD Oil
fo45d8y	1587498473	Eagles	team	I have no idea why youre downvoted. If we took him at 53 Id be whelmed. Taking him at 21 would be a massive fucking reach. No idea why Eagles fans as a whole seem to love him.
fo45dah	1587498473	Cowboys	nfl	When I was watching this play live I really thought Romo was gonna get broken. I remembered I loudly gasped and my wife came to see if I was alright. Then this madman makes this spin move and throws a TD. I was left speechless staring at my TV with my hands on my head. I saw magic that day and Im never going to forget.
fo45dba	1587498473	Cowboys	nfl	Payton left the Cowboys go take the Saints job in 05? He was a big reason why the Cowboys drafted Romo, as they both played at Eastern Illinois and Romo broke all of Paytons QB records. Before going after Brees, Payton tried to trade for Romo, but Jerry said no.
fo45dht	1587498476	Saints	nfl	Oh fuck you
fo45dit	1587498476	Buccaneers	team	Holy shit yall really gonna have brady and Gronk I feel some type of way about this
fo45dj7	1587498476	49ers	nfl	Now THATS what I like to hear!!
fo45dfk	1587498475	Chargers	team	Yes exactly! I feel like Tom has put us in a position this offseason where drafting or not drafting a QB isnt as impactful as it should be this upcoming season which is a luxury in itself, I mean how many teams can say theyve lost their HOF franchise QB and arent worse off or desperately and I mean desperately need a new QB to save their franchise. The Pats? Us this season? Thats about it. Although we will need a franchise qb, the argument Im making is strictly for this upcoming season.
fo45duv	1587498480	Vikings	nfl	Patriot fans in absolute shambles
fo45dlm	1587498477	Redskins	nfl	Way better than Trading Back, K, BYU
fo45dmt	1587498478	Rams	team	Rams just need to post a picture of the new jerseys, no video, no hype and end this rebrand disaster. I am ready to move on to actual football and watch as they scramble for a redesign in 5 years  as they realize no one is buying this shit.
fo45dng	1587498478	Patriots	nfl	Hahahah FUCK
fo45doa	1587498478	Patriots	nfl	Give us Howard
fo45doz	1587498478	49ers	nfl	WRWhats really crazy is this team has drafted the GOAT Jerry Rice and TO, yet we are still historically bad when selecting that position. Hopefully picking guys like Deebo is the new trend.
fo45dzh	1587498482	Rams	team	Chargers fans, and well its Reddit, its hard to have an opinion on here
fo45e5p	1587498485	Chargers	team	I miss him
fo45eca	1587498487	Chargers	team	Wel when he retires hell likely sign a 1 day contract to retire as a Charger. Maybe hell get a jersey for that one day? 
fo45dqb	1587498479	Eagles	team	Exactly. If they get Murray they need to move up in round 2. If they sit back and wait for 53 there wont be anybody worthwhile left
fo45dqo	1587498479	Bengals	team	Yes please.
fo45drv	1587498479	Eagles	team	Yeah, same two cents. Not sure what my friend was reading there.
fo45e5r	1587498485	Patriots	team	What do you want to bet the source is Gronk on the radio today saying that hes not completely done playing. That said, if he DID actually come back...yea I mean Id have assumed his preference would be to play with Brady and a loaded offense.
fo45e7x	1587498485	Lions	team	Dude this exactly my point thats where the media has these guys going, not scouts and front offices. Thats for entertainment purposes they dont know what its like to evaluate a player. They are only compiling various information across the country and trying to fit it in what people are going to do on draft day thats what mock drafting is all about it has nothing to do with talent evaluation from the medias perspective. They are paid to write a story and thats it. How many elite talents do you think are in each draft class? Spoilers its not 32. Its not 5 either, or 3. Its usually a lot closer to 12 on an averagegood year. Youre assuming that every front office has a universal evaluation of all elite prospects because thats what the media suggests they should be ranked as. Thats entirely false. No FOs think exactly the same because theres more than one way to win, more than one philosophy and more than one way to evaluate a player. Andrew Thomas isnt flashy, so he gets mocked lower, but his game shows him dominating the highest level of competition in the NCAA, same as Wills. Thats what makes them elite talents, a mock draft done by CBS suggestion they go 15th overall does not. You also have to go by a teams roster construction and scheme fit. If you have two guys ranked as elite talents, but one fits an immediate or future need, then you draft that player regardless of the mythological positional value that gets thrown around. Sometimes guys fall because of schemeneed pulling ahead when it comes to grading. I guaranty you, there is not one front office person who gives a shit about what the media says they should do with their picks. If that were the case, Dwayne Haskins would have been a Top 5 pick last year and Josh Allen would be on the Giants while Daniel Jones would have been drafted in Round 2.
fo45e8g	1587498486	Vikings	team	So were trading up for a WR in Rd 1. Got it.
fo45e9t	1587498486	Chargers	nfl	Hehehe
fo45edk	1587498487	Giants	nfl	Gronk literally from the top rope
fo45ej9	1587498490	Buccaneers	team	unfortunately, the offseason might be extended a bit
fo45dx3	1587498481	Eagles	team	Well, thats a shame...I dont know guys. Im not much for charity, but the kids had a rough go of it. I say we take him.
fo45esq	1587498493	Patriots	nfl	Ill take another third round pick for Gronk.
fo45f3d	1587498498	Patriots	team	For OJ Howard and a late round pick? Cant say Id be opposed
fo45f52	1587498498	49ers	team	He is a GOAT among GOATs. The peoples GOAT if you will.
fo45elu	1587498491	Vikings	team	hahahah cool
fo45eqt	1587498493	Falcons	nfl	Its all we have. Just let us have that.
fo45ez2	1587498496	Buccaneers	team	Bruh I posted this like 2 weeks ago and yall deleted it
fo45fco	1587498501	Vikings	nfl	Hes all the fuck over the place depending on who gets asked. I know production in college means pretty little, but I just dont see how he could be that talented in a major conference and go undrafted. Unless there is some crazy shit under the surface. But his character concerns seem sort of bogus. His coaches go to bat for him on twitter and shit. Local reporters said he never said no to an interview. And I dont see how it could be a work ethic character concern. With just aight athleticism he converted from a QB to a really good receiver in pretty short order.
fo45f2o	1587498497	Broncos	team	You are almost there.  Just need about 9700 more!
fo45f55	1587498498	Falcons	nfl	I agree, fuck this shit
fo45f6a	1587498499	Packers	team	All pro? He played 3 snaps last year lmao
fo45f7j	1587498499	Jets	nfl	Goodbye OJ Howard
fo45faw	1587498500	Lions	team	I was about to post this on here and Im fucking dying. Dollars to donuts gentleman is like, well fuck me sideways.
fo45fb4	1587498500	Cardinals	nfl	The rights to Gronk for OJ Howard
fo45fmy	1587498505	Giants	nfl	Im really curious, how is someone a legend, when theyre not even top 3 all time on their own franchise?
fo45f63	1587498499	Ravens	nfl	If you knew what you were looking at, Brees time at Purdue showed you what the future of the NFL would be like...and the eventual NFL Leader in every QB stat.
fo45fcn	1587498501	Buccaneers	team	Double TE set with OJ and Gronk. Lord have mercy.
fo45fhr	1587498503	Eagles	team	Oh nick, we would never.  And we will beat the piss out of any mother effer that does!
fo45fqx	1587498506	Titans	team	As a fellow quarantine birthday, Happy Birthday and Titan up!
fo45frz	1587498507	Saints	nfl	So in your view, I can paint any explicitly non racist sentence in a racist light and thats the only way I can understand the historical dynamic of the NFLs labor force? Please.
fo45fk4	1587498504	Falcons	team	Only one of these jokes Ill upvote lol
fo45g66	1587498512	Lions	team	Current size? Hes 64 240.  Luke Kuechly was 63 238.  Bobby Wagner is 60 242.  Patrick Willis was 61 242
fo45gcx	1587498515	Patriots	nfl	What the hell is going on
fo45ghy	1587498517	Vikings	team	Only available in MN and western WI only... well shit...
fo45g3l	1587498511	Dolphins	nfl	Tanenbaum when we draft Tua be like httpsyoutu.be0zjrwDU19gc

fo45gca	1587498514	Lions	team	Amen.
fo45gsp	1587498520	Eagles	team	Thank you uHesiPullUpBrando for correcting me
fo45gk7	1587498517	Cardinals	team	Whats the article say?
fo45gr6	1587498520	Cardinals	team	yeah, looks photoshopped around his neck
fo45gyp	1587498522	Redskins	nfl	be the change you want to see in the world
fo45gmb	1587498518	Raiders	nfl	oh for FUCKS sake
fo45h6h	1587498525	Texans	nfl	Leroy had this scoop like two weeks ago, not sure why hes not getting credit here
fo45hbw	1587498528	Patriots	nfl	Make it stop
fo45hce	1587498528	49ers	team	Tyler Johnson in the late 2nd or 3rd would be the best value pick for us at WR IMO. I also like Pittman in about the same range but hes a bit more likely to go in the 3050 range I think.
fo45gyn	1587498522	Giants	team	I chose Cushenberry for what thats worth  anchors well in pass protection, quickly regaining his balance to redirect vs. counters, stays connected to his man with quickness and tenacity on the move, an ironman with the lower body agility, natural power and dependable intangibles to be a starting NFL center.
fo45h3a	1587498524	Cowboys	team	You should keep it to yourself.It, in this case, is your drooling inbred level stupidity.
fo45hhj	1587498530	Chiefs	nfl	Im enjoying this era of Pats football.
fo45hoz	1587498532	Cardinals	team	He did. That hurts a bit. Although the lineman Ive seen rumored to go before 8 didnt really include him... have seen Thomas shoot up this week and then the obvious between Wills and Wireds. Thomas going to Miami at 5 would be huge (if true)
fo45hdg	1587498528	Ravens	nfl	Fuck imagine Gronk and OJ Howard.  Brady gets his 2 TE sets again.
fo45hjw	1587498531	Bears	nfl	Lamar is much closer to RG3 than Mahomes in terms of play style though.
fo45hne	1587498532	Seahawks	nfl	Not yet, apparently its being considered for 2021.Youre right there are 3 different styles, but these are just stickers which can be replaced
fo45i3n	1587498537	Bears	nfl	y u do thisy u hurt me
fo45hjn	1587498531	49ers	nfl	Hahahaha virgin hahahahacries in virgin
fo45hop	1587498532	Broncos	nfl	Robpa Bay
fo45i7o	1587498539	Browns	nfl	I cant believe its not Barry
fo45ibd	1587498540	Vikings	team	Not really. You can do things to hide bad OL play through playcalling and scheme. Motion, misdirection, quick slants and hitches (lots of west coast concepts), multiple TE sets, etc. Tons you can do to hide any weaknesses.If your WR gets beat, you cant hide that. If you run man and your CB gets beat, you cant hide that. And so on. Thats why for the better part of a decade weve seen teams like NYG or OAK invest heavily in OL and it hasnt turned out too well. Thats why we saw one of the best OLs in history on the Cowboys go 412. A great OL can make a great team excellent. But you shouldnt be investing heavily in it until youre already a great team.
fo45hva	1587498535	Falcons	nfl	WHY COULDNT THIS BE BARRY FOR ONCE
fo45i55	1587498538	Chiefs	nfl	AFC aside from the Jags usually gives us the most trouble.
fo45ig3	1587498542	49ers	nfl	Rally monkeys and thundersticks still haunt my nightmares
fo45hx9	1587498535	Patriots	team	This would be a HUGE kick in the balls. Not only is my franchise QB gone, your ALSO taking my retired all star franchise TE?  Fuck off man. If true worst year of my life by far, and were only in april.
fo45i14	1587498536	Dolphins	team	I dont think their planning on having 2 of the 3 highest paid cbs in the league.
fo45i32	1587498537	Vikings	team	I didnt even think about how 22 might be valuable to jump New England and New Orleans for Love. Spielman said they are likely to take BPA at 22 and look at trading back with 25. But Im sure 2 seconds would get it done for 22 as long as the depth is still there to get someone they want at 25 which seems likely.
fo45iaw	1587498540	Ravens	team	I feel like PFF overly relies on their grades for prospects.
fo45idg	1587498541	Broncos	team	I watched every game that Keenum played under Shurmur a few years ago, and I dont remember many specifics other than it made Keenum look good enough that I was pumped at the massive leap we were about to make now that we had Keenum instead of Trigga Trev. O(
fo45ifi	1587498542	Eagles	nfl	Calm down. It wasnt JUST like Dak last year.
fo45iso	1587498547	Rams	team	I really think were looking at Floyd to play inside, hes a little tall but I think his game translates better in the middle.
fo45iuj	1587498547	Redskins	team	TIL Terry McLauren, Adrian Peterson, and Derrius Guice arent weapons
fo45ijm	1587498543	Eagles	nfl	Okay, and how does that relate to kickers being taken with high draft picks?
fo45itx	1587498547	Vikings	nfl	WATCH OUT WATCH OUT
fo45j2w	1587498550	Vikings	nfl	Used to work with a girl that looked just like her.
fo45iqm	1587498546	Browns	nfl	This is true. If you throw a dart right at your receiver, but a safety read the pass and intercepts it, its still an accurate pass. Just a stupid one. I dont see why people dont understand that
fo45j1h	1587498550	Packers	team	I laughed way too hard at this
fo45j2d	1587498550	Browns	nfl	Lol wtf
fo45j6f	1587498551	49ers	nfl	Did I miss something about the one helmet rule? How can they have three different helmets?
fo45ixh	1587498548	Chargers	team	Anybody love the new jerseys but miss the old number font?
fo45jhr	1587498555	Patriots	team	probable. Theres no reason to leak this if nobody thinks hes coming back. It doesnt hurt his value so whats the point? Get his name back out there for his products? He can do that on any podcast or interview.
fo45jra	1587498559	Browns	nfl	Holy shit Return of the GronkHes gonna have the time of his life in Florida
fo45j9k	1587498553	Bears	nfl	WTF
fo45jef	1587498554	Bears	nfl	Credit Leroy the Dog
fo45jhk	1587498555	Cowboys	team	The most part jealousy, cowboys are the center of attention, on every segment on every sports show, radio show, the franchises is the most valuable, the players are the most conversed.People love to hate and nothing like hating on the most recognizable team.
fo45k3a	1587498564	Lions	team	Sniper like accuracy
fo45jua	1587498560	Giants	nfl	Im still waiting for Jim Halpert is Trash.
fo45juq	1587498560	Redskins	nfl	stop reading food blogs
fo45jx9	1587498561	Raiders	nfl	Brady Gronk Howard Evans Godwin holy shit
fo45k4r	1587498564	Patriots	nfl	As a Pats fan, hope Bill lets him go. No point holding him hostage. He has cemented his legacy with us.
fo45kdn	1587498568	Vikings	team	Or he knows that the entire fan base is stuck on WR and wants you all to calm down when he doesnt go WR.Reddit more stuck on Ruiz than WR. Which at least Ruiz you can argue that this IOL draft class blows.
fo45k7l	1587498565	Raiders	team	I would be all for trading 12 to move up if we keep 19. It would be ideal to then trade 19 to move back and net a couple more picks before the 3rd round.
fo45kbx	1587498567	Seahawks	team	No way, he can only run go routes! Mel Kiper personally told me that.  s
fo45l6e	1587498578	Chiefs	nfl	Well Luck fucked right off outta here lmao.
fo45ksn	1587498573	Vikings	team	I would not bet on Thuney being a sure thing in a new, completely different scheme and without Coach Scar
fo45lbp	1587498581	Patriots	team	Yeah this is a win for both teams. Trading him and  Thuney could net some good picks
fo45kwu	1587498575	Cowboys	nfl	Agree 100 percent
fo45l8t	1587498579	Dolphins	nfl	Inb4 Dee Virgin has a son named Chad, who becomes the very embodiment of mediocrity in his NFL career someday.
fo45la3	1587498580	Patriots	nfl	(
fo45lb9	1587498581	Ravens	nfl	Plenty of regret to go around. Lions wont take him. By 2022 youll be much more pissed off.
fo45lvu	1587498589	Giants	team	Thanks for the kind words! I like the Urlacher comparison. Our dline should be able to eat up blockers, like you said. I think Simmons can add more strength, and he uses his long armsagility to keep blockers off of him on runs up the middle.
fo45lk0	1587498584	Lions	team	Well you could get quality Defense playrrs in the second or 3rd round sooooo
fo45lpr	1587498586	Patriots	team	Yeah, cheap moves like signing backup DTs and backup FBs work when you have the GOAT QB? That equals basically tanking
fo45lqp	1587498587	Eagles	nfl	Long shot but does anyone know any artist that would be good at kobolds and with open commissions? Looking for a more gritty style rather than a cartoony style.
fo45lsi	1587498587	Vikings	team	Packer bad
fo45lyb	1587498590	Chargers	team	I havent either, Im not the type to classify a player a bust after one season, two seasons? Maybe but only if you didnt show any improvement whatsoever.
fo45lz9	1587498590	Ravens	nfl	Just stay away from those strawberries and youll do fine. Those completely destroy your body
fo45ly6	1587498589	Vikings	nfl	They could have been a dynasty if the NFL had changed draftee contract rules a few years before they did. Stafford, Johnson, and Suh all on team friendly deals?
fo45lyv	1587498590	Eagles	team	Oh for sure fuck the Saints.
fo45m45	1587498592	Jets	team	I like it.  They peaked the last couple of years without a playoff win.  Its all back downhill from here.
fo45m4k	1587498592	Ravens	team	Uh, yeah. Ide be okay with that
fo45mim	1587498597	Vikings	team	How much?  I just bought a couple of acres on Mars. I want to build an interplanetary kingdom.
fo45m7b	1587498593	Browns	nfl	Id add the next years pick, Courtney Brown, to this team specific list.
fo45ml6	1587498598	Panthers	nfl	Would you sign any WR to a 25 mil contract?
fo45mmw	1587498599	Falcons	nfl	Alright think of it this way. You have a very nice Web cam and microphone. They stopped working all of the sudden, unplugging them and plugging them back in doesnt work and neither does restarting the computer. You have to be on national TV in 2 minutesWhat do you do?
fo45m9j	1587498594	Steelers	nfl	This offseason is delivering in these dark times

fo45mjd	1587498597	Dolphins	team	This is my exact thoughts, if they actually like herbert then they really need to learn how to keep their information in house
fo45moo	1587498599	Chargers	team	Am I the only one wanting to get an LT jersey in this edition?
fo45mxh	1587498602	Falcons	team	i cant fucking believe it 
fo45mdg	1587498595	Vikings	team	Recommend what?
fo45mr2	1587498600	Eagles	nfl	Okay, and how does that relate to kickers being taken with high draft picks?
fo45mlf	1587498598	Broncos	nfl	After a long day of 420 Gronk said fuck it Im back
fo45mqe	1587498600	49ers	nfl	Innocent people are just anyone out in public. The protestors are obviously people who are going to try going on with normal life regardless of the stayathome measures. So if they catch it, theyll be infecting an exponential amount of people. And its not like the masks are 100 effective.
fo45n9n	1587498607	Colts	team	I wouldnt be mad at just about any QB pick honestly. Theyll be given at least a year, likely two, to sit and learn from Rivers, Reich, and Jacoby. I just dont want to reach but if we believe someones the guy, I cant call it a reach. You go get your QB if you believe in him.
fo45n9x	1587498607	Bears	team	We are set up this year to not need to draft a QB and still be successful this year we have Foles. Our starting QB position is now filled for the next 3 years (lets assume we dont pick up Trubiskys option and he walks), which is probably our window for our current defense. Any QB draft pick would realistically be developmental under Foles and would start after our defense needs a rebuild. If thats the case we should wait a year or two to find the right QB for Nagys system instead of drafting a QB just to draft a QB. Unless the plan is to flip said QB for draft capital, which Im all for.
fo45nf8	1587498610	Jets	nfl	WWE in shambles
fo45nhn	1587498610	Buccaneers	nfl	Well, this could be fun.
fo45msy	1587498601	Texans	team	He is a bust because they brought him in specifically to be the entire system, a plan he 100 bought into.
fo45mth	1587498601	Eagles	team	How does a local radio host have inside info on WR from Alabama who just played a full season?   If shes leaking bad info to get him to fall to us, Ill allow it.
fo45mxd	1587498602	Falcons	team	I want to believe. I know the amount of picks wed have to give up in order to jum all the way to 2 would scare any GM, but Id actually love it TD pulled it off.Theres also a lot of talk about many teams wanting to trade down instead of up since the class is so deep, which could make it a bit easier for us to make a splash and get either Young, Okudah or Simmons.
fo45myc	1587498603	Eagles	team	And the Eagles were gonna meet with Willie Gay too(httpstwitter.comaaronwilsonnflstatus1252683448059387911?s21)
fo45myi	1587498603	Packers	nfl	what about his fruitful WWE careeoh yeah they fired everyone
fo45nhw	1587498611	Giants	team	Ruiz would be my 1 choice, but assuming he is not there Kenneth Murray would be my second choice (assuming he is there).
fo45nk9	1587498612	Lions	team	Pretty much, Okudah is far from a guaranteed playmaker fresh out the gate, his instincts are top notch, but having thought about it, the 40 time could play a role in growing pains at least for the first couple years. An elite pass rush can alleviate those growing pains not just for him, but the other DBs with him. Id still rather have Simmons, thats most especially if there will be slight transition to a more 43 centric scheme.
fo45nbe	1587498608	Vikings	nfl	Why? because it completely made you second guess the whole situation? You came to the realization that youre like all the other sheeps following the media spin? Why dont you actually make a point or disagreement if you have one?
fo45nox	1587498613	Browns	nfl	Thanks! I really enjoyed the first one and had no clue there was a second part
fo45nqo	1587498614	Patriots	nfl	I CANT BELIEVE LEROY CALLED IT
fo45ntm	1587498615	Cowboys	nfl	I dont see the validity of either of those complaints and think theyre excuses. Nfl and college rules are different enough theyre basically different sports.  Also data doesnt really support the injury risk claim for hurry up offenses. Faking injuries is bullshit, there are other ways to get rid of those but outlawing the hurry up offense because of it isnt the way to go. Keep your D well conditioned.
fo45nxa	1587498616	Ravens	nfl	Gronk wants to come back and play for the Bucs good boy Leroy!
fo45nr1	1587498614	Steelers	nfl	boop
fo45ntt	1587498615	Cowboys	nfl	Ive argued all day about those penalties. Ultimately, even if you side with lions fans on it, the Lions have no one to blame but themselves. Still had . multiple chances to win.
fo45nvn	1587498616	Chargers	nfl	And credit to Terrell Owens making the plays too. Such a good duo
fo45o8g	1587498620	Ravens	team	Were not a Browns run franchise but for the Ravens, making the playoffs two times in 6 years is bad
fo45o0y	1587498618	Lions	team	I can see that. But I gotta think teams had outlines for trades prior to Coronavirus, and the trades arent conducted in person on draft day. I dont know if a virtual draft will change anything all that much. They used phones and Skype before this year. The thing I worry about is that teams might not want to trade without having the visits and medical rechecks with their own doctors. But I did see that Miami quickly got a visit in with Tua before the NFL put an end to visits, so fingers crossed.
fo45o17	1587498618	Cardinals	nfl	Shit, TB and AZ did a similar trade for BA when he unretired
fo45o1e	1587498618	Patriots	team	OJ and a pick for Gronk
fo45o3f	1587498619	Patriots	team	Were starving while we wait for the draft
fo45nwy	1587498616	Browns	nfl	Joe Thomas. Never made the playoffs.
fo45oki	1587498625	Redskins	nfl	Sorry you havent driven anywhere in 3 weeks your tank is full.
fo45oe4	1587498623	Packers	nfl	I think it will happen. There will be rules and players will have to follow them or be suspended. Same as other rules.
fo45ofi	1587498624	Giants	nfl	I like it
fo45ok4	1587498625	Chiefs	team	Good long overdue
fo45ok7	1587498625	Buccaneers	team	Im not so sure bruce would pass on brady, even if jameis sat the last 2 games. Arians has 2 seasons left tops and thinks our D will be top 5 next year. The fact he wanted bridgewater speaks volumes.
fo45onm	1587498626	Broncos	team	4am to 10pm! I hate free time because I go crazy so I spend a lot of time watching film. Im also a teacher. Appreciate you man. I just want to give Broncos Country quality content that they can connect with and learn something in the process that they may not have known prior!
fo45orj	1587498628	Panthers	nfl	This would be so shitty for Panthers, Saints, Falcons and Pats fans
fo45oi7	1587498624	Raiders	team	If we got Mims and Terrell Id be ecstatic. Id love to get Lamb or Ruggs, because I personally dont like Jeudy that much! I feel like the Raiders are sitting in a good spot to come out of this Draft a winner.
fo45oo4	1587498627	Texans	team	Try Houston lol
fo45ope	1587498627	Packers	nfl	Holy shit Leroy did it, good boy
fo45oz0	1587498631	Patriots	team	I see no reason to hold him hostage. Has done everything we asked.
fo45osn	1587498628	Broncos	team	Same
fo45ov7	1587498629	Browns	team	Training camp helmets had grey face masks last year as well
fo45p3s	1587498632	Cardinals	team	Keim seemed very high on Thomas in Flight Plan, would be nice to get a lineman that would stick around for more than 5 years and make an impact. Weve needed a line for a long time
fo45p5q	1587498633	Dolphins	team	Stop trying to rip apart the smokescreen Mort, theyve been building it for months now.
fo45p46	1587498633	Ravens	team	We made them only twice and missed them 4 times
fo45ppd	1587498640	Patriots	team	Hes going to be 30 next year. The smart move is trade him before he starts deteriorating.
fo45p5h	1587498633	Falcons	nfl	Suck my dick god damn it
fo45p6o	1587498634	Cardinals	team	if he is there. yes. He could go as high as 4. A lot is in flux. I doubt he is rated above Okuda, Simmons, Chase Young, Ceedee, or Ruggs though.

fo45pc2	1587498636	Patriots	nfl	Wow. Win for both teams if this happens. Tom gets Gronk. NE gets some comp for a player that likely wasnt going to play for them anyway
fo45pyb	1587498643	Cardinals	team	Its tough for a team to think 23 years ahead. GMs and coaches are on a short leash so almost always in win now mode. Rarely do you see a raidersgruden situation where they give 10 yrs to control the team. Gruden has the flexibility of trading away top talent for draft picks to rebuild the position players and hold off on getting rid of carr. I think carr will be gone next year when raiders have enough pieces in place. Your theory assumes two first round number 1 picks though? How you going to get burrow otherwise? Too risky.
fo45q6d	1587498646	Titans	team	I have the same curse. Buy a jersey and two years later they are gone...Id go with lewan though. He should be here for a while haha.
fo45q6c	1587498646	Lions	nfl	Just because he feels that way, doesnt make him a sheep. Its ok to have different opinions, even if they do suck like yours.
fo45pwp	1587498643	Cardinals	team	Kyler is basically Larry level of untouchable to me rn. Id take him over anyone other than  Mahomes.
fo45pyu	1587498644	Bears	team	Is it a big beef?
fo45q18	1587498645	Browns	team	And hes not awful in coverage. He also is a perfect fit in places like Baltimore where they are desperately missing the good run defender and interior LB pass rusher. Which imo is their worst position on their team. In fact I wouldnt be surprised if Baltimore moves up for him.
fo45q23	1587498645	Falcons	nfl	Congrats on OJ Howard
fo45q4e	1587498646	Patriots	nfl	I made this for HUBBY and he LOVED it, and you know how kids can be. Can you say PICKY?Anyway, start with a whole box of Kraft Mac and Cheese and put some salt on it. Thats it! Artisinal Mac and Cheese! Oh throw some provolone in there too! YUM. Hubby threw the GOOD FUCK in me after scarfing this shit.Then the top comment3 stars. We didnt have any Mac and cheese so I made some old fish sticks as a substitute but I dont like fish??? May have been better if you have all the ingredients.
fo45qe8	1587498649	Falcons	nfl	the only way the NFC South will be united
fo45qew	1587498650	Bengals	team	Who in the national media called him joe exotic?
fo45q0r	1587498644	Eagles	nfl	Theres no basis for saying Jackson is inaccurate. Theres plenty of basis for saying Daniel Jones is though httpspbs.twimg.commediaENEDldXXkAE7BZ8?formatjpgname4096x4096
fo45q48	1587498646	Patriots	nfl	Lol why? Bill already tried to trade Gronk once before. This isnt that surprising.
fo45qaq	1587498648	Raiders	team	You forgot the Patriots. And the Chargers.I feel like the kicker worries get passed around the league. Few teams solve it for decades at a time. Usually the curse descends upon a franchise for a few years and then they figure it out.My favorites with the Raiders were Jim Breech who missed a 19 yard FG against the Chiefs in 1979 to tie the game and send it into OT. I think Al cut him the next week and then Breech spent the rest of his career kicking for the Bengals.Then there was a Errol Mann, a retread from the Lions. A straight over the top kicker like Mark Moseley he was horrible when he played for the Raiders. The year Oakland won their first SB Mann missed something like 6 PATs and half of his FG attempts. I know he missed a couple of kicks in the SB. Woof.
fo45qj4	1587498651	Vikings	team	Im really curious, and havent been able to find much, on TYPE of WR the Vikings are looking to draft.  Do they want another route technician, a big bodied redzone threat, a spedster who can stretch the field? Does it matter to them? Whenever I see a WR mocked in the first the article almost never mentions how Thielen and his skill set might impact the pick. Its always the same ol  Vikings HAVE to replace Diggs ASAP and this player in the first will do that.
fo45qi1	1587498651	Browns	team	Agreed!
fo45qj2	1587498651	Vikings	team	Buying and building these sets
fo45qqx	1587498655	Patriots	team	Best of the Belichick era is a bit hyperbolic. Ty Law, Stephon Gilmore, and Chandler Jones are all in his tier.
fo45qgx	1587498650	Buccaneers	nfl	One way or another it seems like OJ Howard is on his way out, whether its to move up in the draft this week or because Gronk is coming back.
fo45qru	1587498655	Seahawks	team	But thats kind of my point as well if youre playing a bad defense then sure you can call whatever you want and itll be effective. But when playing a good defense you have to keep your play calls diverse or else youll get shredded, hence you need a run game to be able to call play action
fo45qv5	1587498656	Chargers	nfl	I remember that time pretty well. They wanted Brees, but were kinda lukewarm about it. The Saints fully committed to going all in on him and Brees noticed the difference and ultimately chose the Saints. Which was a big gamble for him at the time because the francise was shrouded with uncertainty.
fo45qxq	1587498657	Patriots	team	Exactly!!!
fo45r2e	1587498659	Patriots	team	This would be great. Hes retired anyway so its not like its here or there. Plus we would get compensation.Im all for it.
fo45r4h	1587498660	Eagles	team	Like she has actual sources.. thats like saying the janitor at the linc has inside info too
fo45rb7	1587498662	Packers	team	Ive heard great things about him so I wouldnt be disappointed if we did
fo45rm6	1587498667	Patriots	team	Would be very happy with this, I know Howard has underperformed but hes still an elite talent
fo45qye	1587498658	Redskins	nfl	trump
fo45r1q	1587498659	Buccaneers	team	I wish I had taken sports law in law school! quick google search says the fine is 5 million per violation, plus potential draft pick losses and contract cancellations. Yeah I dont think Id want us to incur a penalty for going over
fo45r4m	1587498660	Patriots	team	Lets get that second round pick back that we lost trading for Shitty Sanu. Bucs clearly in win now mode...
fo45r8y	1587498661	Bears	team	Does Pace need a half pack of smokes?  Thats about all he will get.

fo45rpu	1587498668	Cardinals	nfl	Woof woof
fo45rqz	1587498669	Lions	team	Let me posit an almost impossible situationlets say tomorrow Burrow gets caught smoking weed or something, ala Tunsil from a few years ago. If he falls into the 2nd round, and hes there for us to take.. think we nab him? Its literally never going to happen  Im just curious what people would think in that situation. I think you have to take him right? Hes the best QB prospect in how long? Luck?
fo45ru5	1587498670	Patriots	team	The Tampa Bay Patriots
fo45rjl	1587498666	Dolphins	nfl	Certainly no dessert.
fo45s3d	1587498673	Packers	team	I think theres some truth to that, but that only makes TE a bigger need. That means we need to draft a guy now to replace Marcedes, or spend in FA next year when we dont have much money at all. I think the lack of good TEs in this class means we may not grab one, but the need is there and its significant.
fo45s25	1587498673	Lions	nfl	Godwin Evans Gronk and Howard good fucking lord.
fo45ryb	1587498672	Vikings	nfl	Sam Bradford.
fo45s9f	1587498676	Patriots	nfl	God damn it.
fo45slp	1587498681	Lions	team	Help for any position can be found in any round, Bobby Wagner was a second round pick, so we should never draft a LB early, Geno Atkins was a fourth round pick so we should never draft a DT early.  If we wanted the next Donald we should have taken Ed Oliver, taking Brown because we now have a massive need at DT only compounds that mistake and still doesnt fill our need for a pass rusher.
fo45slt	1587498681	Rams	nfl	Specifically in super bowls, Patriots
fo45sf8	1587498678	Bears	nfl	Just trade OJ Howard for Gronk, easy peesy lemon squeezy
fo45sj3	1587498680	Ravens	team	Done. Thanks for the heads up. GL to us !
fo45sxg	1587498685	Patriots	team	What really sucks is that if he unretires is going to totally screw our cap up, so were going to have to trade him for shitty value
fo45sjx	1587498680	Buccaneers	team	2020 is quite possibly the wildest year of all time.
fo45sl1	1587498681	Lions	team	Playing devils advocate here wouldnt it be good logic to add a presidential talent to your strongest unit. They might suck else where but theyll have a top 2 defensive line
fo45syt	1587498686	Broncos	team	I think the real crime is the shade of orange Nike has been using for our color rush uniforms... and that ugly ass stripe on the arms of the jersey. We look like the brown in those lmao
fo45t7i	1587498689	Saints	nfl	We need to put a hit on that bitch down on Florida
fo45ssb	1587498683	Patriots	team	Unreal
fo45sy0	1587498685	Dolphins	team	Then why is he a first round talent? The guy is clearly talented and saying hes the equivalent of McDonalds vs steak is just moronic and ignorant.
fo45szs	1587498686	Patriots	team	He was planning for postBrady for awhile and the best he could come up with is Jarret Stidham and the worst WRTE group in the league? Doesnt sound like very good planning.
fo45t2n	1587498687	Bears	team	You have two nutsacks?
fo45t62	1587498688	Cardinals	nfl	Going off how bad he was hurting the last few seasons this is pretty surprising. Guess he figures that Arians will be a lot more laid back than Belichick, if Belichick even agrees to trade away his rights
fo45t39	1587498687	Buccaneers	team	wed probably trade OJ if we get gronk unfortunately. No need to have 3 starting TEs.
fo45tfs	1587498692	Patriots	nfl	Stop hurting me
fo45tln	1587498694	Saints	nfl	Man this division...
fo45tok	1587498695	Falcons	nfl	Bad dog Leroy
fo45t13	1587498687	Rams	nfl	That OJ Howard rumor makes sense now.
fo45t34	1587498687	Patriots	team	I hate 2020. May as well trade Jules too while youre at it, if you really want to twist the knife
fo45t60	1587498688	Falcons	team	I think it would be extremely nave to not think the number will drop drastically. The simple fact that 4 million have been tested and nearly a million of those are positive points to millions that have it with no symptoms.
fo45t7o	1587498689	Patriots	team	What is Gronks value? Howard and a second or third round pick?
fo45tgd	1587498692	Ravens	team	Lol this is what every sports game fan says. They never do change. Always the same shit.
fo45ts6	1587498697	Browns	nfl	Didnt he have drug  alcohol problems before and during Atlanta as well?
fo45tji	1587498693	Jets	nfl	This is something that only Cowboys fans have been clamoring for, and theyve done so without any facts and just trying to read between the lines. So lets get some things straight. 1. Were not shopping Adams. If you call, we listen. Just like last fall. Were not the ones calling, and were gonna have to be blown away by the offer. Again, just like last fall. 2. His price is not just a 1st rounder. Its 2. His price at the trade deadline was a shade under what the Jaguars got for Jalen Ramsey(httpstwitter.comAlbertBreerstatus1189270535714344960). So lets put to rest the idea that Jamal is worth only 17. 3. Joe Douglas has said he wants Jamal to be a Jet for life. Even today he said that Jamal was a big reason for him picking the Jets job(httpstwitter.comRichCiministatus1252678627151556610?s19). JD said a lot of good things about Jamal today, but Im sure this wont stop idiots from thinking that the Cowboys should be calling the Jets and offering half of what Jamal is really worth to us. 4. Extension talks are going to happen. In fact, both sides initially talked at the combine, but the front office is currently focused on the draft. I expect the extension talks to heat up by next week. No, our relationship with Jamal isnt at a breaking point. The man will get his money and end up the highest paid safety in the NFL, and itll probably come with a pretty hefty signing bonus as a little cherry on top.

fo45une	1587498709	Vikings	nfl	This is exactly how I feel too. I dont think hes a Day 1 prospect, but he checks enough boxes to be a Day 2 guy. All the character concern stuff never made sense to me. Ive never heard what the concerns even were, let alone if they were true. I have a few friends plugged into the university and a couple of friends of friends of TJ and no one has a single bad thing to say about him.
fo45urf	1587498710	Titans	nfl	Exactly. Jacoby Brissett is 9th alltime in yards. Jacoby Brissett is also 9th alltime in QB starts. The Colts have also had 15 seasons with 3 different QBs making starts. They have also had 17 seasons with a backup QB making at least 3 starts.
fo45v1e	1587498714	Chargers	team	Thanks!
fo45v2v	1587498714	Browns	nfl	Its tempting to say that first overall is the obvious answer.  That is obviously a superelite ability.  However, teams that played his team would adjust to try to keep him off the field.  They would play for the turnover every time, and they know his team is never going to go for it on fourth down, so they are never jumping offsides on a hard count either.  It also would cause a rules change as 31 of 32 teams would vote for rule to obviate this superpower.  Id say 4th round for the impact he would have in his 12 seasons of play.

fo45w0f	1587498727	Patriots	team	Who copied UCLA.
fo45wb3	1587498731	Bears	team	Literally just take his contract. we dont want anything else.
fo45wc2	1587498731	Colts	nfl	Didnt Davis only play for like 3 years
fo45wh1	1587498733	Falcons	team	
fo45wjr	1587498734	Eagles	nfl	I mean it almost happened in 2018 with Michel and Chubb. Not crazy to think it can happen but its really not likely. The top 5 thing definitely wont happen again
fo45w72	1587498729	Ravens	nfl	He needs to stay retired. The last season he played he looked rough.
fo45w7u	1587498730	Lions	team	Ive been out of the loop regarding OLine what makes wirfs a risky pick?
fo45weo	1587498732	Chiefs	team	It was really the public pressure on 810 that got his ass fired. The advertiserspartners then started pulling out and the station had to do something. Had the dipshit apologized and said he should have never brought Reids family into it, his loud mouth would still be sitting on his high horse railing on Hill.
fo45wij	1587498733	Packers	nfl	This list is all types of wrong
fo45wml	1587498735	Bills	nfl	 I even dont hate the redsI absolutely love the color rush jerseys.
fo45waq	1587498730	Cowboys	nfl	This is just to get people to talk about it
fo45wif	1587498733	Patriots	nfl	You build a roster to make the most competitive team.  A team with four good receivers, a great tight end, and mediocre linebackers, is worse than a team with three good receivers, a great tight end, and a stud linebacker.  If you already have Deion Sanders, Champ Bailey, and Richard Sherman, but an average OL, do you draft Darrelle Revis or upgrade the left tackle?And if you dont understand the argument of looking at every other exceptional team in history, and how 98 of them  eventually had a game (or games) where the strength of their team was only average suggests that the Chiefs (or anyone else, for that matter) will do the same thing, I cant help you.  I cant.
fo45x2u	1587498742	Dolphins	team	Dicks out for harambe.  Smokes out for Herbert.
fo45wzl	1587498740	Ravens	nfl	Still gonna pass on giving EA another dime
fo45x02	1587498741	Jets	nfl	Im so ok with this.
fo45x7a	1587498743	Titans	nfl	This whole offseason has been a ploy by Brady to get Gronks WWE belt
fo45x7j	1587498743	Falcons	nfl	Fun fact When they were writing that song it was originally called Brother(httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vzZ5B5BebuO4)Really wish I could hear the full version with those original lyrics.
fo45x3z	1587498742	Cowboys	nfl	I dont think it makes any sense whatsoever. Dak has never missed a game, improved every season, and is already proven. If this was two years ago people would say the same shit about Darnold or Mayfield would you trade up for Darnold or Mayfield now? And those guys dont have the injury history that Tua has. Another thing is everyone keeps attributing all this contract negativity towards Dak but does no one think its the FO that had Dez and Zeke hold out? The FO that made D law postpone his surgery because they were playing hardball with him? Our contract negotions outside of Jaylon (who got taken to the cleaners) have been highly contentious lately so Dak doesnt deserve all the blame.
fo45x7n	1587498743	Lions	team	just wanted to share JRobs (Titans GM) setup httpswww.reddit.comrTennesseetitanscommentsg5kd3wjrobsdraftsetup?refsharerefsourcelink
fo45xjx	1587498748	Patriots	nfl	Wouldve loved to see how far Andrew Luck could go if he wasnt chosen as a sacrifice to Ryan Gregsons ritual.
fo45xso	1587498751	Chargers	team	Love confirmeds
fo45xff	1587498747	Patriots	team	Gronks antics during his retirement has been really annoying. Taunting comebacks every month and now saying he will comeback now to play with brady?Fine that will be oj howard and brate plus a 3rd
fo45xg4	1587498747	Packers	nfl	There was a Packer by that name in the 1980s I believe.
fo45xnp	1587498750	Patriots	team	I gave a very sour taste in my mouth regarding all of this now.
fo45y0z	1587498754	Chiefs	team	Lmao I wish I was BJ
fo45xe7	1587498746	Eagles	team	Hopkins and MT both have high 4.5 times, would you not want them?
fo45xoi	1587498750	Dolphins	team	Can we make this the post instead?
fo45y3c	1587498755	Falcons	nfl	NO GOD NOOOOOOOOO
fo45y8t	1587498757	Cowboys	team	You cant plan everything out perfectly, but if you have a chance to get a top player at his position for only a 1st in a draft year that has scouting setbacks due to pandemic, why would you not?the first issue is what are his salary demands and the second issue is he worth his salary demands and finally the third issue is is it worth a firstround pickFor me though I think he is a very talented player I just cant justify burning another firstround pick to acquire player who is immediately going to cost me a pile of moneythis would likely mean we would have to start to restructure other players contracts and that begins a snowballing process like interest on a credit cardHes still on the rookie dealand is very likely going to want a significant raise and restructuring immediately upon agreeing to a trade.
fo45yab	1587498757	Steelers	nfl	All 766 Chargers fan like this
fo45yem	1587498759	Patriots	nfl	Hes still 247 champ too.
fo45y67	1587498756	Cardinals	nfl	Time to get Leroy verified
fo45y79	1587498756	Colts	team	Yall didnt want them at all throughout this offseason but once people found about this rumor suddenly theyre not horrible options?
fo45y8d	1587498757	Bills	nfl	Doesnt Arians like rarely utilize his TEs?
fo45ya1	1587498757	Redskins	team	This is how OJ becomes available
fo45yoz	1587498763	Patriots	nfl	Yeah at this point take what you can get for him. Only way you see this year is if both teams make the SB.
fo45yto	1587498765	Bears	team	Yeah well Khalil Mack is a thing
fo45ytu	1587498765	Browns	nfl	He did it for mentions. The list is blatantly controversial. No way he thinks half these things
fo45yw2	1587498766	Dolphins	team	My God could you imagine? Tua at 3 and Thomas at 5?
fo45yrc	1587498764	Eagles	nfl	Doh!Thought itd take longer for someone to get this.
fo45z18	1587498768	Buccaneers	team	pls dont sacrifice OJ
fo45z61	1587498769	Colts	nfl	YA MUM
fo45z7u	1587498770	Jets	team	Really will be difficult over the next few years to root for an overall good team with a mediocre QB.  The arent going anywhere.
fo45zc4	1587498772	Saints	team	Sean Payton doesnt draft line backers in the first round.
fo45z50	1587498769	Bears	team	I doubt he makes it to 40 either.  He seems like a safe bet for the late 1st.
fo45zah	1587498771	Seahawks	nfl	I fully agree. That Colin Cowherd said this.
fo45zjd	1587498774	Eagles	nfl	Its really not that bad for a team that trades for him.Something like 9 mil for a single year with no other guarantees to worry about.
fo45zv6	1587498779	Patriots	team	Dont need a No.1 corner when your tanking. Plus, hes 30. Trade him would be the smart move but I have zero faith in Belichick actually making the right move
fo45zgd	1587498773	Rams	team	Ive been saying this for years. Certain sports teams are so dogshit at branding and making uniforms. Who would get hurt from teams just putting up a prize and just choosing a logo from thousands of submissions? Theres no way this logo cost them any less than just picking one from the internet and just buying it. Christ
fo45zhj	1587498774	Patriots	nfl	Lmao this list is a joke
fo45zk6	1587498775	Redskins	team	OJ come on down
fo45zrz	1587498778	49ers	team	Devin Duvernay
fo45zro	1587498778	Vikings	nfl	Crazy how good he was. If only he wasnt an absolute brick shit house.
fo46011	1587498781	Panthers	team	 It is the one defensive position we have a good player at(Short) and I also think we should just sign Damon Harrison.We have 0 cap space after the draft and just because we have one good defensive lineman doesnt mean we dont need more. KK is coming off a season ending shoulder injury, is 30, and is going to be learning a new system.Hes not a NT, and were severely lacking in that department (as is evident by the fact that I couldve rushed for 100 yards against this team last year).
fo4608r	1587498784	Falcons	nfl	
fo46090	1587498784	Buccaneers	team	Quick question why would he have to be traded?
fo460c0	1587498785	Patriots	nfl	Having the Bucs logo next to Tom isnt even the worst thing about this list and that hurts
fo460mg	1587498789	Cardinals	team	A Quenton Nelson type of guy would be awesome. The thing about Keim that scares me the most is actually his ability to evaluate offensive lineman.... It has not been good. Im still mad about Jonathan Cooper. Thank god he turned that into Chandler Jones somehow
fo460jl	1587498788	Chargers	nfl	Mike Evans is fantastic but I would put Hopkins or Jones on here before I put him
fo460qw	1587498791	Ravens	nfl	This is the way
fo460tg	1587498792	Patriots	nfl	You dont believe in the 3TE2WR set?
fo460np	1587498790	Ravens	team	 httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vdQHUAJTZqF0(httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vdQHUAJTZqF0)
fo460y2	1587498794	Patriots	team	He played injured after the Ravens game last season.
fo4616n	1587498797	Bears	team	Wtf no? I have 3 just like everybody else.
fo460rd	1587498791	Cowboys	nfl	Yeah, but I was intentionally avoiding even arguing over the penalty itself.
fo460w6	1587498793	Patriots	team	Id do it in a heartbeat. Reunite Brady and Gronk, get Stidham an elite young talent at TE.
fo4616f	1587498797	Vikings	team	Is that the safe word this time?
fo461dv	1587498800	Cardinals	team	we would have a higher pick without murray, but not 1 I dont think. Probably like pick 3. So we would be more likely looking at Tua.
fo461kc	1587498802	Lions	team	I just prefer not to have blind faith in a coach and GM who have shown zero results during their tenure here.
fo461mt	1587498803	Colts	team	Patriots and Buccaneers have been discussing a trade for retired TE Rob Gronkowski, per league sources. Gronkowski has one year and 10 million left on his contract. But the two sides are, and have been talking, prior to Thursdays draft.(httpstwitter.comadamschefterstatus1252686680152322048?s21)
fo4612x	1587498796	Browns	team	We are in a winnow mode. Thomas makes the most sense. He is ready to start Day 1 protecting Bakers blind side.  Beckon is oozing with potential. But Thomas is a safer bet with a very solid future ahead of him.
fo461bv	1587498799	49ers	nfl	That all navy one is sexy as hell!
fo461hr	1587498801	Patriots	nfl	Thats over dramatic. But since we must fundamentally see how the game is played from the QB position differently, here is a fun look at his throwing that has nothing to do with playing QB but at least is a meaningless sort of just for laughs look at his accuracy(httpwww.nfl.comvideosnflprobowl0ap3000001098891LamarJacksoncompetesinPrecisionPassingSkillsShowdown)
fo461j1	1587498802	Ravens	nfl	I dont even know where to start.
fo461w8	1587498807	Buccaneers	nfl	YOLO
fo461ps	1587498804	Bills	nfl	Hes into the next level beyond shit tier tbh
fo461og	1587498804	Raiders	team	I agree
fo4620b	1587498808	Cowboys	nfl	I think a lot in these threads are severely underestimating the sheer number of people each team is going to have involved in making decisions in an incredibly short amount of time.  Why leave anything to chance that one of them wont be available when you need their input?
fo46280	1587498811	Jaguars	nfl	Is he even in football shape? Saw a pic of him, and he was pretty skinny.
fo461si	1587498805	Redskins	team	The real crime in this scenario would be taking Cole Kmet at 20. Either way this trade still wouldnt be good enough for me
fo461t8	1587498806	Patriots	nfl	(
fo462gf	1587498814	Browns	team	Man thats a clean jersey. I gotta get me one of those
fo462i7	1587498815	Patriots	team	Try not letting sports affect your life that much man.
fo462co	1587498813	Chargers	team	I have spoken
fo462ip	1587498815	Vikings	nfl	Because the market for QB is high. Pick a good FA that would improve on Cousins for a good value.
fo462fy	1587498814	Cardinals	team	Dude hes been saying it for months now. Hes made it clear. We need to draft OT or Defense though. We are probably paying Hopkins top money and we dont need WRs anymore. We need defense mainly
fo462ly	1587498817	Buccaneers	team	Hes on the Pats roster
fo46310	1587498823	Chargers	team	Derwin for me. I have 0 salt for him. I still have maybe .0000005 salt left for Bosas rookie year.
fo46331	1587498823	Ravens	nfl	I personally wouldnt rank him 1 but I dont think its super unreasonable or anything Wilson is an amazing player.I think the bigger outrage is the lack of Buck Allen in the top 10
fo46366	1587498824	Raiders	nfl	You would get return too so why not.
fo463jl	1587498829	Lions	team	Weve signed so many corner. Ive been saying it, Okudah wont be the pick
fo46371	1587498825	Eagles	nfl	If youre bored at home and looking for something productive awesome to do, look into playing around with Unreal Engine 4, Quixel Mixerbridge.All of its free.
fo46373	1587498825	Falcons	nfl	
fo463b5	1587498826	Buccaneers	team	Even though he is retired?
fo463ef	1587498827	Patriots	team	Because I called you out for taking a picture in the bathroom with one of the most germ infested items we own? Alright remind me to not go to your restaurant.
fo463j2	1587498829	Jets	team	Oh, mustve misunderstood. You cant wait for it to be over.... whereas, most fans cant wait for it to start. Got it.
fo463jy	1587498829	Seahawks	nfl	I would love to see this normalized for years in the league, but Im too lazy to do it myself.
fo463vh	1587498834	Chiefs	team	Him and Seth Keysor are definitely my favorite Twitter follows
fo463zp	1587498835	Patriots	team	Im fine with Parcells getting in the Patriots HoF eventually, but theres like 25 people ahead of him who arent in yet.  (Many arent retired).  Hell even if just for bringing in Belichick as AHC in 1996. Seymour Vrabel Gronk Wilfork Welker Lawyer Milloy Jerod Mayo Mankins Scarnecchia But by the time they get in, then many of the following nonretired people will be eligible Belichick Brady Hightower Edelman Gostkowski Vinatieri (he hasnt officially retired yet) Gilmore Devin McCourty Chung Collins Butler Trey Flowers Chandler Jones Marcus Cannon David Andrews Slater McDaniels James White
fo463iw	1587498829	Buccaneers	team	What the fuck is 2020
fo463sh	1587498833	Jaguars	nfl	Tampa should just be called New England south
fo4646f	1587498838	Lions	team	Except when youre Caldwell
fo463sa	1587498833	Bills	nfl	Theres almost no chance Bill holds onto him, why would he decline the free pickplayer hell get for a retired guy
fo4649w	1587498839	Patriots	nfl	Would love to see this happen. Pats get something valuable from Gronks otherwise expiring contract, and we get to see Gronk back in the NFL on a SUPER TEAM
fo463z1	1587498835	Titans	nfl	Simpsons.
fo4643t	1587498837	Packers	nfl	Thats very fair. After watching a ton of highlights he is definitely a guy who knows how to work the rules and make others play to his style. He also is just incredible at basketball though, which I think a lot of people try to underplay because of his reputation.
fo464em	1587498841	Cardinals	team	Lets hope hes leaning on Kugler for that!
fo464gr	1587498842	Falcons	team	Better not draft a coverage linebacker in the 5th or 6th then.  Which might be the point. Predraft bullshit. Maybe. Hopefully.
fo464gv	1587498842	Panthers	team	Idk how I feel about this. Seems like Tepper is positioning himself to move the team to SC which would be dumb
fo46504	1587498849	Bears	team	And if we really wanna be depressed, we can admit that Emery is a better drafter in the first round than Pace, and the first round is arguably the most important.
fo464nj	1587498845	Vikings	team	If Im releasing it on 420, its only fitting to have 420 players, right?
fo464ok	1587498845	Giants	team	It would be awesome if one of those guys fell to us at 36! Im hoping there will be a run on receiversQBs in the first round
fo464rn	1587498846	Falcons	nfl	So instead of talking to your HC, scouts, owner about who youre gonna pick you dedicate your time to unpacking new hardware?  I dont see what a dedicated IT person would be able to do to remedy the problem eitherBring in a new pc, reinstall drivers, literally do anything tech related while you do your actual job so you can make the league look good on TV
fo464vd	1587498848	Vikings	nfl	Your about the 5th person to say my opinion is shit throughout this thread, but not one of you have stated a reason why. What is your specific disagreement?
fo4651t	1587498850	Buccaneers	team	I neeeeed a gronk a Bucs Jersey. Make it happen.
fo46575	1587498852	Patriots	team	Sad but welcome news. Any asset we can get for Gronk is a major plus
fo465au	1587498854	Vikings	nfl	Are you kidding me? Mahomes had to miss games, its his worst nightmare!
fo465ay	1587498854	Patriots	team	I want atleast 14  Howard for Gronk  23
fo465du	1587498855	Vikings	team	Keep seeing his name, hes the last player from our position needs that I want drafted. We need size and speed on the outside, thielen and Sharpe already play the slot. Just my opinion, plenty of people love the guy.
fo465ge	1587498855	Steelers	nfl	Man sometimes I really feel like reddit is maybe a few thousand real people and hundreds of thousands of corporate accounts
fo465hh	1587498856	Redskins	team	Credit Leroy the dog
fo465pl	1587498859	Patriots	team	What even is 2020
fo465aa	1587498853	Colts	team	Really? Why?
fo465cy	1587498854	Ravens	nfl	The Last of Us wasnt that great, IMO. It was a zombie game built out of zombie tropes.
fo465fq	1587498855	Patriots	team	Taking after the Detroit Patriots and the Miami Patriots in the worst possible way, with Brady and Gronk 
fo465p0	1587498858	Bills	nfl	By arians offense never utilizing the TEs
fo4661e	1587498863	Packers	nfl	OJ Howard for Gronk, straight up.
fo46639	1587498864	Falcons	team	And youre being.... unnecessarily negligent. You wanna say, peoples lives are at risk. So answer the question.. who exactly are you okay with putting at risk? Yourself? Your parents? Your grandparents?
fo46685	1587498866	Ravens	nfl	I cant believe the Bucs might be the reason the rest of the NFC south bands together. What the fuck is 2020
fo466dj	1587498868	Falcons	team	Remember, isolation was only to flatten the curve. No one said COVID19 would just disappear.
fo466np	1587498871	Jets	team	Jameis is special.  You cant be that good and that bad at the same time without being that good.  Or something.  Baker doesnt huck it up quite like winston does, but he has a penchant for risky throws.  Jameiss bad throws arent risky, they are just fucking dumb most of the time.  I dont even get it.  Like maybe if I just throw it real hard, hell catch it?  Right?
fo4663j	1587498864	Bears	team	Yes.
fo466aw	1587498867	Rams	nfl	What about Gronk for OJ straight up?
fo466as	1587498867	Patriots	team	Pats have the leverage. OJ Howard and a mid round pick.
fo466j3	1587498870	Falcons	team	Cause our unis look like XFL outfits. They are growing on me the more I see players in them. But the numbers? The ATL logo? Its just meh..
fo466oz	1587498872	Chargers	team	I think everyones biggest problem is that youre telling people to counter argument the problem with the jersey, but you arent even telling anyone why you dont like it
fo466w5	1587498875	Bears	team	Wait, did you just call walter payton a functioning run game?Ive seen hot takes before, but this is hot mag ma
fo466zp	1587498876	Patriots	team	
fo466g0	1587498868	Bengals	team	I thought I was the only really pumped for this! Glad Im not alone. Thursday cant come soon enough!!!!
fo466qi	1587498872	Buccaneers	team	Oh that makes sense thanks
fo46765	1587498878	Rams	team	I agree 100.  I live in DC so I feel a little less affected by the logos it as its not plastered all over my town.  But I still cringe every time I see it on ESPN or NFL Network.  I absolutely wont buy any gear with the new logo.  I may even try to find some knockoff gear using old logos if its high enough quality.
fo466lf	1587498871	Eagles	team	Im a Jefferson skeptic not because of position but because I just dont think hes very good. He doesnt generate great separation. Hes not great catching bad balls (but had very few thrown to him because Burrow is great). Hes not an elite route runner. Hes a 2nd or 3rd round prospect on talent and I really just dont see any qualities that make him a first rounder.
fo466xa	1587498875	Patriots	nfl	Drafting is one part of being a GM in the NFL.
fo466wl	1587498875	Saints	nfl	NO
fo46716	1587498877	Seahawks	nfl	Youre gonna get like a 5th, and probably give up a pick of your own.
fo4675p	1587498878	Jets	team	The Bills have no excuses this year.  TB is gone, the division is wide open, they have a good coach, and a great defense.  Unfortunately, they have Josh Allen as their QB and they fold like a lawn chair in big games.
fo4677b	1587498879	Vikings	team	Hadnt considered that.  Now I have.
fo467id	1587498883	Ravens	nfl	OJ Howard and a 6th Rounder? Pats expressed interest in Howard last season, definitely have to think they will be asking for him in any trade for Gronk.
fo467oa	1587498885	Patriots	team	If he comes back and forces a trade I hope we dont retire his jersey number no matter how many picks we get
fo4670f	1587498876	Cardinals	team	Most underrated comment Ive seen. Kugler changes EVERYTHING
fo4670x	1587498877	Jaguars	team	This is amazing, this is why we are the best sub!
fo467sf	1587498887	Redskins	team	Dude was huge.  Green was much faster, and but Carmichael would just put his arms up and there was nothing Green could do.  It was like looking a Dad play with his kids.
fo467vt	1587498888	Broncos	team	We literally got Jax last year. He will play out his contract with us, and if he plays like he did last year we will be looking to lock him up again.Were not looking for his replacement. But we are always looking for players with potential and ability. No matter how you look at it safety is not a priority. We have much larger, glaring issues on this roster to worry about than our third safety.
fo467hs	1587498883	Patriots	team	Im not doubting the source. Im doubting that it actually happens.
fo467l7	1587498884	Patriots	team	Agreed. In an offense thats tailored more to his skillset Howard could become an elite tight end. He would be an incredible parting gift from Gronk.
fo4680j	1587498890	Patriots	team	Or for Howard straight up
fo467q0	1587498886	Buccaneers	nfl	You telling me I might need to buy another jersey?
fo467ya	1587498889	Chargers	team	OOF 
fo467vu	1587498888	Patriots	nfl	Absolutely! They would be better off on having a contest to pick the best designed uniform voted for and designed by the fans. Better sales, better involvement.
fo4680x	1587498890	Redskins	team	So basically Gronk isnt going to the Bucs
fo46856	1587498891	Panthers	nfl	OK, and what about the millions of African slaves who suffered under chattel slavery while we tried to handle things civilly? the number of white families torn apart by the civil war pales in comparison to the human cost of not forcefully abolishing slavery decades before we did.
fo46874	1587498892	Buccaneers	team	Why post when you have nothing to contribute and you sound like an idiot?
fo468jf	1587498897	Broncos	team	You are welcome.  I know that an eleven minute video like this probably takes you hours and hours to produce.  It is nice to see this stuff instead of some of the low effort content that dominates the sub sometimes.  Just wanted to let you know that it is appreciated.
fo467yj	1587498889	Steelers	nfl	He still wouldve made whatever tag he signed that season. 25 mill or whatever that may be. Totally worth the risk.
fo4683p	1587498891	Broncos	nfl	The only correct answer.
fo468ba	1587498894	Colts	team	Didnt he have a contract with QB Club?
fo468g7	1587498896	Redskins	team	Yeah take kmet a little early... which means we maybe could trade back a little more if necessary and pick up a second rounder and it still get kmet in the late first.
fo468i1	1587498896	Eagles	nfl	I am forever grateful that Jerry and co decided to keep rolling with Dak instead of putting Romo back in when he came back.
fo4686q	1587498892	49ers	nfl	The Pats better not agree to send Gronk to Tampa UNLESS the Buccs are willing to completely bend over in any deal. Otherwise theyd be potentially creating one of the most dominant offenses ever seen. Brady could play till for another 5 years with those weapons, or at least until Gronks body starts to break down again.
fo46888	1587498893	Jets	team	Right?  WTF happened to CNN?
fo4688w	1587498893	Patriots	team	Everyone in this sub bashed the news when it came out two weeks ago
fo468le	1587498897	Colts	team	Suing a multi billionaire is a gamble
fo468sj	1587498900	Seahawks	nfl	Bucs and kc games gonna be  spicyyyyy
fo469og	1587498911	Falcons	nfl	That is one of the most hurtful things anyone has ever said
fo469h2	1587498909	Patriots	nfl	Is that the dog?
fo469ib	1587498909	Falcons	team	Height, no, isnt a problem. Its his weight thats the issue. Look at it like this, right now hes 51 pounds lighter than JJ Watt 62 pounds lighter than Calais Campbell 33 pounds lighter than Myles Garrett and 13 pounds lighter than DeMarcus Lawrence (and two inches shorter to boot). If Simmons is the pick, I would not be upset because I think a pass rusher is the biggest need at the moment, but I worry about his size. Body wise, hes very similar to Vic Beasley. Now, is Simmons a better athlete than Vic coming out? I believe so, but body size does account for a lot when youre having to fight through blocks. If he is that small, he may have to rely more on developing moves to get through, something Beasley couldnt do.
fo46a20	1587498916	Dolphins	nfl	Tuas left handed, so his blind side would be the right side. So wed need a RT, not necessarily a LT like Williams. In any case, Im not sure Flo and Co will want to spend assets on an expensive, aging, injury prone tackle anyways. Id rather they draft one.
fo469ow	1587498911	Ravens	team	I bet everyone who grade this poll low will still watch it lol
fo46a60	1587498918	Packers	nfl	He even did this one lmfaooo
fo46a2a	1587498916	Chiefs	nfl	No I just think its possible that some quarterbacks fail because of themselves and not because of the carousel of excuses that gets applied to every single guy that fails to meet expectations.
fo46a5g	1587498917	Colts	team	I agree but I also think it depends in the system he gets drafted too.
fo46a5q	1587498918	Vikings	team	Honestly what he said is 100 perfect strategy. It totally liberates him. Trade up in rd 1 and grab a WR? It was a smokescreen and it worked because we got our guy. Wait to grab one until late rounds? We told you that was our strategy and were happy with the value we got.
fo46a4l	1587498917	Packers	nfl	This is what I was thinking. But on which side?
fo46ara	1587498926	Patriots	team	We need picks and OJ Howard
fo46a4y	1587498917	Bills	nfl	I tried to find a vid of yall losing in the AFCCG but It doesnt exist, thats crazy.
fo46adw	1587498921	Cowboys	nfl	Delpit at 17 is a reach
fo46agp	1587498922	Vikings	team	Both of your 2nd rounders and we give one of our 3rds. We have a high quantity of picks so I would imagine by trading down we would want to move up another pick.
fo46a70	1587498918	Patriots	team	Sad boi hours (
fo46a80	1587498919	Jets	team	You nailed it.
fo46ad7	1587498920	Bears	nfl	Lol youre dreaming
fo46afn	1587498921	Titans	nfl	Its always the same and clean cut.
fo46ai3	1587498922	Rams	team	OMG!  Did you have to say it OUT LOUD?!?!?  Sigh.
fo46aio	1587498923	Eagles	team	Reminds me of kendricks
fo46ali	1587498924	Cardinals	team	he definitely can be there at 8, positional value is pushing him down. Not to say he will, but its possible. He could go anywhere from 310 right now as a realistic range.
fo46ayl	1587498929	Eagles	team	All Im saying is I cant see a top prospect not having a good time in Philly. Where did they take him, a walk around fairmont at night? Also i dont know  where hes from but he still seemed pretty shook in the video of him talking about it
fo46axt	1587498928	Buccaneers	team	I guess now we know why the OJ rumors came back.
fo46arc	1587498926	Chiefs	nfl	The Chiefs are now in Dolphins countyMatt Moore was a former Dolphins QB, went 11 while Mahomes was outRyan Fitzpatrick is the current Dolphins QB, defeated the Patriots IN FOXBOROUGH in Week 17 to secure us the 2 seedRyan Tannehill was a former Dolphins QB, went on to knock out the Patriots in the playoffs and lose to us )Hard Rock Stadium is home to the Dolphins, who gave us the good luck needed to pull off a SB comeback.Hail the Dolphins
fo46aug	1587498927	Dolphins	nfl	I dont think theyre dunking on him so much as trying to figure out whos most likely the second QB off the board. For you, that isnt a big deal but for us it is.
fo46b2o	1587498930	Vikings	nfl	It initially came from Matt Miller when he was fighting with a dude on social media. And he said local sources, that were never substantiated.I get why hes a 4th round prospect, its a super deep class and his athleticism is a question mark, which also his pro day got cancelled. But to say hes got character concerns just feels like dirty BS.
fo46b74	1587498932	Patriots	team	They can have Thuney also. Gronk, Thuney for their 1st and Second and OJ. Give that 1st, 2nd and Stidham to Cincy. We get Burrow. Who says no.
fo46b88	1587498932	Patriots	nfl	Off a hefty contract and get a decent draft pick to give up a player who isnt even playing anymore?Sign me the fuck up!
fo46bjv	1587498936	Buccaneers	team	I honestly would rather just keep using the TEs that we already have.
fo46bpy	1587498939	Redskins	nfl	1) trading with Detroit still has the risk of someone else trading with us, and them missing out on Tua2) the trade wouldnt happen unless Detroit is a part of it, so theyre not really passing up on Young. And since the Giants would certainly take a LT at 4, they basically have the same options at 5 that they would have had a 3 without any trades. Either with the trade or without, theyre basically guaranteed their choice of either Okudah or Simmons.I think the trade could realistically look like thisWAS trades 1.2 to MIADET trades 1.3 to WASMIA trades 1.5 and 1.18 to DET, and trades a 3rd to WAS
fo46bo6	1587498938	Jaguars	team	Im still confident that Yann gets moved IF Chaisson goes in the top half of the 1st. If someone misses out, hell be gone.Fournette, day 3 at the earliest
fo46bsn	1587498940	Vikings	nfl	Okay fine.  1) They absolutely could have gotten more for the trade, and saying otherwise is moronic.  2) You assume you know context because of the secondhand context.  This is what we would call a leap at best.  3) You keep saying things are your opinion.  I and the downvotes are letting you know that your opinion is just wrong.4) Players want off teams that dont treat them well.  Thats not disloyal.  Youre so sure about things you know nothing about that Im assuming you went out to protest the shutdown
fo46c6n	1587498945	Panthers	nfl	The color rush contains 3 colors so its not really monochromatic
fo46c0u	1587498943	Steelers	team	Well Lamar Jackson is on the new Madden cover so we should be a solid bet for 1st place next year
fo46c1b	1587498943	Browns	nfl	That 2018 game where Baker came in down 140 and played almost perfect to rally to a 2117 win while Darnold threw two late INT was fucking therapeutic.
fo46c5b	1587498945	Dolphins	team	Trading 18 and 26 to get an OT and QB at 3 and 5. Boom
fo46cc8	1587498947	Chargers	nfl	Of course....next is Belichick
fo46cd5	1587498948	Patriots	team	Im asking for a lot it if I was the pats fuck it
fo46chf	1587498949	Patriots	nfl	(
fo46cjd	1587498950	Patriots	team	I have no idea what his value is considered in a trade. Also wouldnt we take a huge cap hit?
fo46ct7	1587498954	Jets	team	Thats my quarterback 
fo46cox	1587498952	Patriots	team	Not a good enough athlete to be a taysom hill
fo46cr1	1587498953	Bengals	team	It would of been a good time to change it this year, with the regime change and new QB, would of been perfect, hopefully next year.
fo46cf1	1587498948	Bills	nfl	Im not even sure what the point of this comment is
fo46che	1587498949	Vikings	team	Again, what does more talented mean? You ranked your qbs...is saying theyre more talented some random qualifier so that you can never be told youre wrong? As of now, Rivers, Mayfield and Murray are worse qbs. That literally cannot be argued. They have worse stats, playoff performance (none at all for all three), worse finishes in MVP voting and odds, and lower on rankings. Someone like Dak, Wentz, Ryan, they can be argued. Someone like Mahommes or Jackson, they cannot he argued. What are you talking about?Draftees have never played a down in the NFL. There is no sample size lol. That is an awful analogy. Just because you dont like being told youre wrong, doesnt make it untrue. Im not arguing your opinions. Im not saying youre wrong for putting Cousins outside the top10 (even if I disagree). Im calling you out for blatantly spewing misinformation, and digging your heels in trying to defend it.
fo46ck1	1587498950	Eagles	team	Lol who is Engenolfs source

fo46dk4	1587498964	Redskins	team	I wouldnt rule it out just because it hasnt happened yet. If I were the Dolphins, and all the good tackles were gone by 18, Id gladly trade one of my 2nd round picks for Trent.

fo46dg1	1587498962	Patriots	team	Maybe they can get more than just Howard who knows.
fo46dql	1587498966	Buccaneers	team	You know thats the only way it could happen. (It shouldnt happen)
fo46dvd	1587498968	Browns	nfl	Thank god

fo46erb	1587498980	Bills	team	I think this is the root of the problem with the Sabres, the current Sabres GM isnt good. They need to get a new GM and possibly a new HC in place.

fo46et2	1587498981	Eagles	nfl	Hope that Brady and Gronk are both past their primes? I think thats realistically the only chance
fo46f0d	1587498984	Broncos	team	You can use the same source and see they were 5th in 12 in 2018 and the Vikings were 7th in 2017.
fo46exy	1587498983	Seahawks	team	 But when playing a good defense you have to keep your play calls diverse or else youll get shredded, hence you need a run game to be able to call play actionBut even with a good run game, play action can be ineffective.Anecdotes dont prove anything.
fo46f1m	1587498984	49ers	nfl	just woke up  those chargers unforms are GORGEOUS.
fo46f74	1587498986	Cowboys	nfl	Ill bet you Reddit gold that Tua isnt Dallas Cowboy after Round 1
fo46ff6	1587498990	Ravens	nfl	Julio too, but Evans at 4 sounds fair
fo46exz	1587498983	Buccaneers	team	My penis is so confused
fo46fl5	1587498992	Packers	team	Exactly. I wouldnt trust a scout to be a good player any more than Id trust a player to be a good scout. Being a good player involves dedicating all their time to working out, studying film, practicing, meetings, and building chemistry during all these activities. While players partake in these activities, you have a team of scouts dedicating all their time to evaluating players to draft by reviewing game film, practice film(?), study mechanics, review tendencies, interview coaches, interview players, background investigation, and what ever else.
fo46fho	1587498990	Giants	team	I could get behind this.
fo46fr5	1587498994	Eagles	team	Now how much of that happens in front of the Ritz?
fo46ftv	1587498995	Chargers	team	I doubt it. Rivers wasnt in any of the hype videos leading up to the release. As another user mentioned, best bed would be a custom.
fo46ffo	1587498990	Patriots	team	Why wouldnt it though? Gronk has already started putting back on weight  the 2 sides have been talking. The Bucs and Tom obviously want him and why wouldnt the patriots want to make a deal? Either they dont and they get nothing or they do and get stuff back for a player who was retired anyway
fo46fit	1587498991	Lions	team	So, CBs can be found later, but runstuffing DTs and offball LBs or safeties cannot be found later?
fo46fs2	1587498995	Redskins	team	Forgot they have Rivers
fo46ftd	1587498995	Patriots	team	Both teams trading with the Pats lol
fo46fs9	1587498995	49ers	nfl	I just dont know how you can a) understand that stayathome orders are in place to slow the spread of the virus, yet b) not understand that people not obeying the orders causes harm to that objective.The entire reason people are mad at the protesters is because theyre disobeying the stayathome orders and (in all liklihood) causing a spike in the spread of the virus. Its not like idiots are isolated in their own little world. We live in the same world as they do, so when they do dumb things like this that can effect all of us, they will also end up harming us.
fo46g4v	1587498999	Jaguars	team	Psychotic wasnt the word you were looking for.
fo46g5j	1587499000	Patriots	team	Hhhmmm that could be pretty genius (if gronk doesnt want to play for the patriots but could be convinced by Brady to play with the Bucs) to get some some assets from a retired players contract.
fo46g9s	1587499001	Seahawks	nfl	oh buddies chicken fried chicken is sooo goood
fo46g0x	1587498998	Patriots	team	Maybe it hasnt only to do with sports
fo46g27	1587498998	Patriots	team	Complete betrayal from Gronk.
fo46g4t	1587498999	Chargers	team	Ok, so I could be wrong, but I think its to avoid making the uniform look too busy. The helmet now have numbers on it, so I think if the Chargers wordmark was on the jersey it would just look a little cluttered.
fo46gbh	1587499002	Patriots	team	Honestly, screw that. Not to be petty, but our offense struggled last year because Gronk left and thats at least one of the reasons Brady decided to leave.Leaves a bad taste in my mouth if this goes down.
fo46g3k	1587498999	Giants	nfl	Before opening  Oh lord here we goSeconds after opening  AHAHAHAHAHA
fo46gf6	1587499003	Seahawks	nfl	Theyre amazing

fo46gos	1587499007	Cardinals	nfl	Yea him or Aaron Donald. Mahomes is in the discussion as well but I think its Donald
fo46gnu	1587499006	Patriots	team	So..Is that 10m off of our cap?Im confused by all of this sorry.Also zero chance we get Howard out of this get real lmao.
fo46gfh	1587499003	Dolphins	nfl	Because Swans are worse than geese and both pale in comparison to wasps
fo46gnm	1587499006	Ravens	nfl	You misspelled Henry
fo46gt6	1587499009	Bears	team	Hi. Me Ryan Pace. Me take short bus to work. Me special. Me make good decisions.
fo46gr4	1587499008	49ers	team	I like how hes acting like Mostert was RB1 and not RB1A to TeCos RB1B. Shanny switched between whoever had the hottest hand.Dude also ignored how they benched Breida throughout the playoffs.
fo46guv	1587499009	Patriots	team	Gronk and Thuney for Evans and Goodwin straight up amiright?
fo46h9l	1587499015	Browns	nfl	I agree maybe even pam too
fo46hau	1587499015	Giants	nfl	Based on the talent of the players we have on it, and based upon their ability to generate pressures and stop the run.
fo46hmd	1587499020	Packers	team	I agree with the majority here that Kmet in the 1st round, especially in a trade up, seems like a very bad choice, but I really dont see why youre getting downvoted for this comment. Youre absolutely right that you dont draft for need. If its a close call between multiple players, then sure, perceived need can be used a sort of tiebreaker, but if theres a clear top guy on the board, thats the pick. Every position of need is one breakout player away from becoming a strength, and every position of strength is one injury away from becoming a need. Just get guys who can play.
fo46hnz	1587499021	Colts	team	Check out the Braden Smith beard!
fo46hpq	1587499021	Patriots	team	Dude what the fuck lmao
fo46hd3	1587499016	49ers	nfl	lmao Bradford was never top 5. Barely top 10. His best year was 2016 with 20 TDs and 5 INTs and just look at everyones stats that year.(httpswww.profootballreference.comyears2016passing.htm) Hes 18th in TDs, 16th in yards, 19th in yards per attempt. Only good thing is completion percentage but thats all on YA.
fo46ht1	1587499023	Redskins	team	I definitely agree with the first thing you said...I think a big reason we cant get good trade value is because whoever we trade to is gonna have to pay the guy 1618m per year.You do bring up a good point that they can set the tone by holding him to the contract he signed. The only thing I dont fully agree with is whether its a GM or coach issue. Based on all the press conferences and the information Ive seen, I personally believe that RR is calling the shots. Im sure he highly values Kyle Smiths opinion, I mean he would have got rid of him with the rest of Bruces staff. So Smith has say, but if the coach said I dont want this guy on my team. He doesnt fit with the culture, I cant imagine a front office executive in the NFL saying tough shit, were keeping him.... At least not unless the coach is on his way out.You definitely brought up some good points and made me think a bit though..HTTR!
fo46hzl	1587499025	Broncos	nfl	yeah sure but dr phil
fo46i06	1587499025	Browns	team	This is a good bet.  Also, Becton is 121 as the first OL taken.  Decent odds there I think.
fo46i3b	1587499026	Giants	team	at this point, no. But I agree with you, jerseys could use a facelift.
fo46i3z	1587499026	Panthers	nfl	if cam ends up playing against us this year i wont have a seconds thought in rooting for him over the panthers
fo46hk8	1587499019	Giants	nfl	Danny wasnt.
fo46hvr	1587499023	Vikings	nfl	We had a shot at a literal Virgin vs Chad matchup last year at WRCB but Chad Beebe got hurt a couple weeks before we played the Lions.
fo46i35	1587499026	Colts	team	I didnt say theyre awful. Eason had one great game and every was posting about him, a lot of people wanted Hurts lately. They just arent immediate QBs with clear expectations.

fo46ivu	1587499037	Patriots	team	Tampa and Cinci. A half alive Gronk and a guard isnt worth a 1st or a 2nd.
fo46iz4	1587499039	Bills	nfl	Lol no they wouldnt. A guy who hasnt played football in a year and has a chronic history of injuries isnt going to tilt the scales for that offense. Especially considering how much weight the dude still has to put on
fo46j4r	1587499041	Patriots	team	Itd have to be a first or second.   Cap hit will hurt

fo46j0z	1587499039	Broncos	team	Bigger issues for sure.... WR, C, and CB are no doubt our biggest holes. But we also lost Will Parks, who was our third safety and Swiss army knife, and he made massive contributions to our defense. We should look to grab someone else like him, who could one day become a starter.
fo46jpr	1587499049	Saints	nfl	Yes  but we should expect people to be able actually be able to separate things that are racist from things that arent overtly racist and not even implicitly racist. I should be able to expect that people will think hm whats more likely, he used a common phrase and misspoke in a common way, OR he is both a racist AND arrogant enough to be so explicitly despite being the owner of a sports team made predominantly of black players.

Before the 2019 season we had 19 mil after signing Tank and we managed to sign Jaylon, Lael, ZekeTank was already on a very high cat figure because of the franchise tag. Ezekiel Elliott is still in the preexisting portion of his contract so his number has not skyrocketed yet. Jaylon Smith and Lyle Collins both signed well below Market deals.Its high time we stop worrying about the cap. Its a joke and can be easily navigated by the FOThis is completely untrue and one of the big reasons we were constantly handicapped at the end of the triplets era and threw most of the Tony Romo era.yes the front office can always do things to squeeze somebody in but it begins to snowball. by definition when you live above your means one year you are being forced to live below your means the next.

fo46k3s	1587499054	Colts	team	If only Andrew unretired as well...
fo46kf1	1587499058	Dolphins	team	Lol big ouch for Herbert. We like you, but youre not man enough.
fo46kq6	1587499063	Ravens	nfl	Previously, the Cincinnati AJ Greens gave us a fair amount of trouble.Hopefully thats over.
fo46kzc	1587499066	Patriots	team	Im not saying change the logo, but ha ign a white helmet would allow us to do throwbacks. I dont want to switch back permanently. Plus they pretty much took all the silver out of their uniforms that it no longer make sense for a silver helmet.
fo46kna	1587499062	Buccaneers	team	Pats have been interested in OJ too, but theyd need to give up more than just Gronk to get him right?
fo46kw5	1587499065	Panthers	nfl	We havent beaten the Steelers since 1996
fo46kzd	1587499066	Patriots	team	I. am. emotional.
fo46kp5	1587499062	Bears	team	Hopefully we can steal a good teams big board, because Paces BPA is how Adam Shaheen got drafted hundreds of picks ahead of where he would have been.
fo46ky1	1587499066	Chargers	team	Me too. So good looking
fo46l1e	1587499067	Jaguars	team	publicly demand a trade and definitelyOh man, were 4 months in and this is already a strong competitor for understatement of the year.
fo46l6e	1587499069	Redskins	team	They probably said that because the guy just went on a huge Twitter tirade against the team, so hes probably gone very soon.Apparently he wanted to leave Jacksonville and made that known, they franchise tagged him and wouldnt return his calls, and now hes going ballistic.
fo46l77	1587499069	Browns	nfl	I honestly cant remember if Ive ever  tried it but it looks like comfort food which is needed right now lol
fo46lea	1587499072	Patriots	team	No cuz wed be trading his contract rights, the contract cap hit wouldnt come into effect until he applied to unretire which would probably only happen after any trade
fo46lfm	1587499072	Bears	team	I mean I understand what youre saying, but Nagy was clearly 1) forcing Mitch to throw because he did not want him running and reinjuring himself and 2) for forcing him to develop as an RPO pocket passer the only way you can giving him more reps.Generally, I agree with you. Nagy fucked up the play calls. He squandered the run game. His O Line schemes were a joke (and if he wasnt designing the O Line plays he is still responsible for the guy who was).That said, I dont think your characterization of how he handled Mitch is fair. Did Nagy put Mitch in the best position to win? No. Did he put Mitch in the best position to develop and grow as a QB in an RPO system? I would argue, yes. Yes he did. Mitch simply couldnt take that next step... for a variety of reasons. But not because Nagy didnt give him the opportunity.The bottom line is that Nagy needs a QB who can run his offense. Nick Foles can and has run a Matt Nagy style offense. So if Foles sucks this year and we see the same struggles as Trubisky, we will know Nagy is the problem.
fo46kzi	1587499066	Bears	team	Yeah I mean the fact that this list looks at Brock Vereen and Leonard Floyd as the same caliber player shows the issue with taking such a simple view
fo46lex	1587499072	Eagles	nfl	Least weve moved on from the Cardinals. What is it with NFC West bird teams?
fo46lit	1587499074	Panthers	nfl	Something looks off with the helmet with the numbers and the bolts position
fo46ldz	1587499072	Jets	team	He had the surgery in 2018........ and had an incredible 2019 with Tua and Tuas back up........ Why does this matter in the least? If you like the guy still, this shouldnt move him back further than Oakland in the draft....
fo46lp1	1587499076	Patriots	team	Well accept nothing less than their first round pick. No reason to do Gronk any favors.
fo46l93	1587499070	Bengals	nfl	What a dumb take. You have to be top 3 all time to be a legend?
fo46m12	1587499080	Patriots	nfl	Brady could play till for another 5 years with those weapons, or at least until Gronks body starts to break down again.So like the first game of preseason?
fo46mea	1587499085	Patriots	team	No cap hit and we might get a 3rd or later pick. Guess it just depends on how much Tampa values Gronk.
fo46m0s	1587499080	Eagles	team	Would I love him on the team. Absolutely. Would I trade our first for him. Absolutely not.
fo46mg0	1587499085	49ers	nfl	I cant think of another sports team that has a greater disparity between the quality of their uniforms and management.
fo46msg	1587499090	Colts	team	Desir got cut six months after signing his extension. Desir and Hooker played on the same side of the field.
fo46mx2	1587499092	Patriots	nfl	My dick has no idea what to do
fo46mys	1587499093	Ravens	nfl	How many legitimate first round talents do you see? Ive been told most drafts have 1820, but I havent heard a characterization of this draft.
fo46ml2	1587499087	Bears	team	Prince is way less replaceable than gabriel. Prince, you know, will actually be missed. Gabriel was fast wide receiver with prosthetic hands
fo46mlp	1587499088	Patriots	team	He couldnt make this decision months ago and possibly have Brady stay in NE. Frustrating how little we did to try to keep this team together.
fo46ms3	1587499090	Seahawks	nfl	What about Gronks WWE deal? Is it binding? Theres no way McMahon just lets him walk...
fo46nb5	1587499097	Buccaneers	nfl	Rumors that Gronk wants to come play with Brady.
fo46n2k	1587499094	Browns	nfl	Lmao Bucs about to send OJ Howard and a 4th for Gronk arent they
fo46n6t	1587499096	Bears	team	This is no diss on Walter, who was the greatest football player Ive ever seen play.   The comment was more on the 2019 Bears inability to run the ball against some of the worst defenses in the league.    Game 1 in 2019, the packers shut down the run in Soldier field.  Every other team in the league ran all over the packers.
fo46nac	1587499097	Patriots	nfl	Gronk is worth more than just OJ, and the Pats have all the leverage
fo46nhj	1587499099	Bears	nfl	Im pretty sure they will basically give him away
fo46nj8	1587499100	Giants	nfl	Thats way too much from Tampas side.The Patriots have 0 leverage here, he will only play for Tampa so there will be no other offers and Tampa doesnt even need him that much so they wont be desperate to get him.
fo46n6v	1587499096	Patriots	team	LOL
fo46nc8	1587499098	Falcons	nfl	Dirk Koetter is still the offensive coordinator. Our defense has to be really good if we want to compete next year.
fo46nd4	1587499098	Falcons	team	I am not saying it is a coincidence or not. I am saying I do not know, and it is wrong to claim I or you do know. That isnt how any of that works.
fo46npd	1587499103	Falcons	team	Yea. Everyone else just went to old unis or colour rush versions were we actually got new unis
fo46npm	1587499103	Chargers	team	I think its for the best tbh. Now we have all our young players wearing the new jerseys. Besides, dad wouldve been too sexy in them
fo46n8v	1587499096	Eagles	team	Same helmet, different sticker.
fo46nim	1587499100	Browns	nfl	Ive heard that. His biggest weakness was that he would hold onto the ball way too long. Baker had a similar problem this year, granted his line was just bad and not made of turnstiles.
fo46njv	1587499100	Buccaneers	team	Im a Pats fan and Im excited AF lol
fo46nr6	1587499103	Packers	team	I thought we were past April fools, Rap... smh
fo46o42	1587499108	Panthers	nfl	Something looks off with the helmet with the numbers and the bolts position
fo46o63	1587499109	Patriots	team	Bucs need a tackle not guard.
fo46obm	1587499112	Chargers	nfl	Yea the blocking is really worrisome.Hes also a pretty boy that idk has the mentality to be an NFL TE (not saying he doesnt have it but team interviews will be important for finding his motivations behind playing).His hands, coordination, strength, and upside are amazing though.
fo46ofq	1587499113	Cowboys	nfl	Its because Romo was the better QB at the time, thats why it is easy to call it in hindsight. Im not sure why its hard to see how a former AllPro QB is better than a rookie QB. The only mystery is how long would Romo be able to play, and that was the risk the coaches didnt want to take in messing up the team momentum. Romo conceded and put the team before himself. No one is upset or mad at Dak for balling out his rookie year, were all just upset for Romo not having one last shot.
fo46oj6	1587499114	Patriots	team	Hes still not that good. Hes spent like his whole career playing with elite WRs like Green and Julio drawing all the coverage and never even had an 800 yard season, wasnt worth a 2nd.
fo46nxb	1587499106	Eagles	nfl	1616 would be considerably below average lol but I agree overall
fo46nya	1587499106	Falcons	team	Cherry picking a mortality rate during a pandemic is not helpful either. You could assume everyone in New York had it and youd get a number.
fo46o1c	1587499107	Buccaneers	nfl	Howard is gone, been trade rumors for weeks.  Brate is very reliable though hes our Edelman.
fo46o9q	1587499111	Vikings	nfl	Why the hell is this the only post about Gronk coming out of retirement? Doesnt even provide context
fo46onl	1587499116	Vikings	team	Tbf, I dont believe anything Rick says ever. Hes hardly ever telling the truth lol.
fo46o6q	1587499109	Lions	team	I dont get your logic for differentiating Okudah and Brown because you use projected to be when referencing Brown but ignore them for Okudah. If we are talking about projections, okudah far exceeds brown in terms of majority thought on his standing and ceiling. Most analysts agree that the kinlawbrown potentialceiling debate leans toward kinlaw, whereas okudah is consistently thought to be a top five, shutdown m2m corner in the future. Okudah also has consistent tape to back that up, locking down everyone on any team without giving up a play over 40 yards nor having a DPI called against him, whereas Brown was neutralized in a few spots, especially the Alabama game. I think brown is a great prospect as well but to say that okudah would be a worse pick from a collegiate performance analysis or projection level would be wrong. Another counterpoint is that this regime hasnt had major success finding good corners in the draft, I would say oruwariye is the best and he has very minimal playtime to make a decisive conclusion. Tabor comes to mind especially. I think Simmons is a different conversation as I have him rated extremely close to okudah but his positional versatility can also be his weakness if the coaching staff doesnt understand how to utilize him correctly, so i think its perfectly rationale for a coachGM tandem on the potential brink of their tenure to go with okudah as a safer, projectable pick....
fo46ogr	1587499113	Jets	team	Jetman looks so serene here, I love it
fo46omz	1587499116	Dolphins	team	In addition to what everyone said, hes still from the Pagano scheme. Apparently not as much of a fit in the new scheme.
fo46oel	1587499113	Panthers	nfl	Im very jealous of people who are great public speakers. I have a coworker who Im just now realizing isnt great at her job, because Im working with her directly for the first time. She has always seemed really sharp and competent because shes such a good speaker. Ive worked with several people like this over the years.
fo46oka	1587499115	Dolphins	team	Imagine if we pass on Tua for Herbert for the reason that Tua wore 13 in college
fo46olf	1587499115	Packers	nfl	Didnt he slim down a ton since retiring? Are we sure hes gonna be able to stay healthy after not being in football shape for so long and with his injury history?
fo46ovs	1587499119	Bengals	team	Not a tiger pattern.
fo46p5y	1587499123	Falcons	team	Haaaaahhhh. I told an old coworker something similar, that Kemp was using the Falcons SB playbook wait until things are under control and then blow it.Oh well, just have to wait and see if it really is that bad 
fo46p34	1587499122	Patriots	team	Clear some cap, get some picks. No brainer. Thanks Gronk!
fo46p56	1587499122	Bills	nfl	Again, at least weve made it. You can come yall to the grown ups when youve made it out of the divisional game.
fo46p32	1587499122	Ravens	nfl	God, I remember those games. AJ Green killed us every single time
fo46p89	1587499123	Vikings	nfl	what the hell is happening
fo46pgb	1587499127	Bengals	team	Reread that first sentence. If
fo46p5t	1587499123	Titans	team	Whats with the black lightning
fo46pif	1587499127	Seahawks	team	Russ a King
fo46pa1	1587499124	49ers	team	Trade down on both picks unless someone we really want falls into our laps.
fo46pa9	1587499124	Patriots	nfl	Fully equipped.  Big kitchen.  Waterbed.  AMFMCD.  Microwave.  Burgundy interior.
fo46pum	1587499132	Seahawks	nfl	You know, Im trying to remember the last time I saw him happy, and Im not sure its been since the SB.
fo46pon	1587499130	Patriots	team	Then they trade Burrow and a 5th for Lamar Jackson. Then we trade Jackson and two 1sts for Mahomes.How many of them could possibly say no?
fo46ptj	1587499132	Saints	nfl	Fiiiiine. Bring on the New England Rest Home for the Aged.
fo46q4c	1587499136	Vikings	team	lol cant wait to see your face in a few days.Almost every time rick has said something like this, he has gone the complete opposite
fo46pw8	1587499133	Seahawks	team	Naw
fo46qck	1587499139	Bengals	team	Im really sick of the stripes that weve had for nearly 40 years now, but this is a cool helmet.
fo46qdk	1587499139	Bills	team	Akers was a high school QB so that gives Brian Daboll so flexibility to use him in wildcat QB plays both as a runner and thrower and on other trick plays like HB toss options. Akers played behind a terrible OL at Florida State and would have to regularly break tackles in the backfield.
fo46q2f	1587499135	Bengals	nfl	Thats every team, really.
fo46q6n	1587499137	Falcons	nfl	(
fo46q5q	1587499136	Patriots	team	Gronk for a 1st or 2nd
fo46qei	1587499139	Jaguars	nfl	JENKINSSSS
fo46qfc	1587499140	Dolphins	team	This would be worse than Dion Jordan
fo46qhi	1587499141	Chargers	team	You will likely be able to customize one or find one from an unofficial source.
fo46qjz	1587499142	Patriots	team	Gronk for 13. Sound like a deal, lmao
fo46qw9	1587499146	Giants	nfl	Montgomery County
fo46qwk	1587499146	Patriots	team	For sure or maybe having a rookie on a cheap 4 year deal is more valuable
fo46qlj	1587499142	Buccaneers	nfl	I really dont think that we need him on the team.
fo46r4g	1587499149	Bears	nfl	Oh come the fuck on. Next thing you know AB moves to Tampa smh
fo46r2l	1587499148	Patriots	nfl	I think Jones will have a big gap up in year 2
fo46r3z	1587499149	Patriots	team	Zack Baun
fo46r50	1587499149	Patriots	team	Fair. Wrong of me of to assume you just meant sports I guess.
fo46re6	1587499153	Cowboys	nfl	What the fuck does Titan Up even mean?
fo46rgu	1587499154	Packers	nfl	Bucs trading Brady back!
fo46rjf	1587499155	Chargers	team	Did you wait 5 hours since the reveal to post this?
fo46rh9	1587499154	Dolphins	team	I hope they dont feel that strongly.
fo46rue	1587499159	Falcons	team	Things change quickly these days. Lets hope for the best.
fo46rww	1587499160	Patriots	team	The patriots literally traded him to the lions the offseason before he retired, he owes them nothing.
fo46rhb	1587499154	Browns	nfl	Tim Couch too. Dude was supposed to sit for a while but the Browns realized Ty Detmer was Ty Detmer and put Couch in the meat grinder in week 1.
fo46rmn	1587499156	Chiefs	team	FelishaNot a big deal, just my Pete peeve with that darn meme. The character has a name and they just ignored it.
fo46ro0	1587499157	49ers	team	As a fellow KentuckyNiners fan, I too would be happy
fo46rtr	1587499159	Eagles	team	Thats just a bad photos hop job
fo46rl8	1587499156	Jaguars	team	I hope everyone in his camp is telling Yann to get finished
fo46rls	1587499156	Patriots	nfl	Pretty sure the Patriots dont give a fuck if TB has a really good offense for a year or two. We may very well not be in the playoffs for that time, let alone worry about meeting them in the SB. That bieng said, we really fucking need a TE, they have a young TE with a lot of potential theyre not using much, they dont need 3 TEs. They should give us Howard for Gronk
fo46rm3	1587499156	Lions	team	Virgin has to work on not holding guys during returns. Dont mind Ford for depth.
fo46s1m	1587499162	Patriots	nfl	Murray is one of my top choices for the Pats at 23. Weve needed young leadership on our defense for a while and I think hes be an excellent candidate.
fo46s4u	1587499163	Patriots	nfl	YOURE TEARING ME APART RAPO
fo46rxa	1587499161	Cardinals	team	This is aint it chief, its even somehow more bland than the current ones, needs some more design, I like all whites tho.
fo46s8f	1587499164	Buccaneers	nfl	I wouldnt do that trade.
fo46sio	1587499168	Patriots	nfl	Let him go and give us OJ
fo46s34	1587499162	Patriots	nfl	 Anything we get for Gronk in a trade with Tampa Bay is found money. Agreed. Not to mention, I genuinely have no idea what his trade value would be right now particularly because he didnt look like the same guy the last time we DID see him play. I feel like if its a draft pick, people (mostly our fans) are going to think it warrants a higher pick on name value alone but it is hard to imagine that in a real world scenario. Hes a great, albeit oft injured player who took a year off and didnt look dominant the last time we saw him. I dont feel he will fetch anything particularly notable but as you said, it feels like anything is gravy.
fo46srz	1587499172	Seahawks	nfl	Theyre gonna do some last dance type doc about last years patriots sometime.
fo46sy2	1587499174	Bears	team	Id rather wait a year before we invested a third or more into a QB.While our QB situation is unknown we also have needs at WR, OL, and CB, and weve at least have a potential high upside option at QB(due to the coaching staff), so I wouldnt say its more of a need than the other positions.Plus, I dont think there will be a QB thats the BPA in the second as well. if we trade back and take HurtsEason if they fall I wouldnt mind, but I think we would get more impact from this draft by going close to offensive BPA(while adding defensive pieces where the value is right), and imo that might have us drafting a QB in the 67th.At the very least it would help form a more solid base if we end up taking a QB in 2021.
fo46smi	1587499170	Lions	team	Lol dee virigin
fo46t62	1587499177	Patriots	team	Same here, getting OJ Howard or even a 2nd for him would be a very nice parting gift
fo46spu	1587499171	Patriots	nfl	OP you should have included Gronks name in the post. Regarding this, I never expected to see Gronk again in NE. If we get Howard for him, Im all good.
fo46ta5	1587499179	Falcons	team	You have to ask if you are comfortable with 3 of your family members, friends, neighbors, customers, dying unnecessarily.Thats the best question. Its one thing to say let 3 die so I can have money when its just a number and its just strangers on the news. Its a whole other ballgame when its your father, mother, brother, sister, wife, best friend, and so on.But there are two things wrong with this discussion. First, the 3 death rate is not some etchedinstone constant. That number is 3 because we have been taking these measures. We have kept the number of severely ill people low enough so our healthcare system is not overwhelmed. Go back to work and the number of people who need to be hospitalized at any given time rises sharply. We run out of room in the hospitals, run out of supplies, we dont have enough doctors and nurses. That happened in Italy and they had to make difficult decisions on who to treat and who to let go. It wont be a 3 death rate any more.Heres the other problem. Again we have the 3 death rate. Also we have 80 of people making a full recovery. What about that missing 17? People hardly talk about those people. Theres a big difference between survival and recovery. It remains to be seen what life will be like for them in the long term but their lives could be forever changed. Theres a big difference between survival and recovery.
fo46th7	1587499182	Jets	team	I hope it doesnt impact his draft stock and everything works out for him. I hate seeing guys of his pedigree fall due to injuries. With that said, I prefer Lamb over him regardless
fo46t4p	1587499177	49ers	nfl	Have they watched Gronk play in the last 5 years?
fo46t7c	1587499178	Giants	nfl	Do Titans fans actually care about or identify with the Oilers though? And I just said colors, not the entire uniform.
fo46t8o	1587499178	Saints	nfl	We need to put on that bitch down on Florida
fo46t8w	1587499178	Falcons	team	I will always prefer a player who wants to be here and is good for the locker room over an elite player, and Fowler seems like he will be both of those things. So glad we picked this dude up.
fo46tb7	1587499179	Buccaneers	team	The greatest team to never play! 2020
fo46tcn	1587499180	Chiefs	team	Am I the only one without any sour grapes on this one?
fo46tcz	1587499180	Broncos	team	Thanks man that means a lot to me! Im stoked for the season to pump our weekly recaps, film breakdowns and more.
fo46ton	1587499184	Dolphins	team	This would be such a bizarre move. All weve heard this year is how deep the tackle class is. Theres four you cant really choose between and a definite second tier that most years would push to be amongst the top linemen available. Why would you waste draft capital to trade up for one of those, when if you really want a certain one he will be there. This only makes sense if you retain 5, which strikes me as very unlikely given that the Lions will want to land a top player regardless, or its misinformation to try and lower the price of coming up for a QB. Those are the only scenarios I can think in which this makes sense. What I think it much more likely is we come up from 18 for a tackle, if one begins to slide. If we do come up to 3 for a tackle and pass up TuaHerbert, I might have to drink like its midseason.
fo46ta7	1587499179	Lions	team	One year contracts at league minimum that they have to sign because we have their exclusive rights.
fo46tvx	1587499187	Browns	team	I still cant believe these are our jerseys again. Makes me happy.
fo46tpn	1587499185	Patriots	nfl	Oh hi Gronk
fo46twb	1587499187	Raiders	team	raiders at 12? Hard not to take him there.Exactly. In all the mocks Ive seen him falling to us at 12 is the absolute floor.
fo46thx	1587499182	Cowboys	team	I think youd be better served asking rnfl as opposed to asking Cowboy fans why people dont like them. I am sure the responses would be much different.
fo46tl8	1587499183	Bears	team	IT SAID BEARS gronk to bears confirmed
fo46tpw	1587499185	49ers	nfl	 Because the people are not following the orders. Im literally seeing it all around.So your solution is to just allow them to not follow the orders even more? That makes 0 sense all around.
fo46tqq	1587499185	Browns	team	Yessir. Damn, I want him to work.
fo46twn	1587499187	Falcons	team	Rico is smart enough to make up for his lack of size with positioning. I think its important that kazee is able to play SS
fo46u5a	1587499191	Packers	nfl	If Im the Pats, I would do the deal in heartbeat if I got Howard and a 3rd or 4th round pick. We all know how much Bellichick loves his TEs...
fo46u71	1587499191	Lions	team	Im worried Okudah wont be there after the Giants.
fo46two	1587499187	Buccaneers	team	Whoaa
fo46ubt	1587499193	Dolphins	nfl	And now hes the new face of NFL announcing.
fo46ucu	1587499194	49ers	nfl	Barry is never wrong scene
fo46uj6	1587499196	Patriots	team	This report can only mean that there is no way in hell anyone thought last year was Bradys last in New England right? If Gronk knew last year that Brady would be leaving New England he would have stayed for 16 games right or am I crazy...
fo46uoe	1587499198	Patriots	team	We shouldnt give any picks away. Gronk is a hall of fame TE
fo46ufu	1587499195	Falcons	nfl	Gronk coming out of retirement to play with Brady in Tampa would be the biggest big dick move.
fo46uh2	1587499195	Bears	team	Our starting QB position is now filled for the next 3 years (lets assume we dont pick up Trubiskys option and he walks), which is probably our window for our current defense.I would not assume that.  Foles has the right to void the contract if he plays well(httpstwitter.comAdamSchefterstatus1240349993401270272).  So either he plays well enough to get more money elsewhere and voids the contract after this or next year, or he sucks enough to not want to leave and we need a better option anyway.  Theres downside regardless of how he plays.
fo46umq	1587499197	49ers	nfl	Thats gotta sting him on a personal level, right?
fo46ui2	1587499195	Falcons	team	Username fits for sure. We arent out of the woods yet. We dont have enough testing to see how bad it really is. We have one of he worst testing scenarios in the country. I literally have a fever right now and a cough but I cant get tested. How the fuck does that makes sense. Since I get get tested I have to work so I get to spread it at work.

fo46v7w	1587499206	Rams	nfl	Steven Jackson was a great RB that had to play for some absolutely abysmal Rams teams.
fo46vdr	1587499208	Broncos	nfl	And kept the tradition going that the Broncos can only win the super bowl with a QB drafted by the Colts.
fo46va1	1587499207	Bills	team	I want to draft both Akers and Gibson. Gibson isnt a pure RB, he is a WRRBPRKRwildcat QB. I see some Percy Harvin in Gibson, he could replace both Andre Roberts and Isaiah McKenzies roles on the Bills.
fo46vqq	1587499213	Eagles	nfl	I dont think I ever realized he played for St. Louis
fo46vzp	1587499216	Patriots	nfl	Im gonna be ecstatic and distraught if this fucking happens.This offseason is on steroids...
fo46vde	1587499208	Vikings	nfl	What is even a reasonable trade here?
fo46vht	1587499210	Titans	nfl	Heck, even though he left, I just bought a new Mariota jersey. Costing less than 30 with shipping might have had something to do with it though...
fo46vyy	1587499216	49ers	team	i was wondering what we were going to do with him. Now that we let Buckner walk, I believe our staff thinks pretty highly of him. It could be a decent starter for us next season. This year was his first time taking NFL snaps and getting back to the field. He wasnt insanely productive, but the coaching staff might be seeing a lot of what were not.
fo46w3h	1587499218	Redskins	team	The Redskins put up 16.6 points a game.5 games last season the offense was held to under 10 points.The offense failed to score a touchdown in 3 straight games last season.If Chase Young could play TE too, then yea Im down.
fo46w6e	1587499219	Packers	nfl	I did consider them giving up a 3rd possibly for Gronk as well, but being away from football is also a factor I considered. Youre right though, Gronk should command a little more.
fo46vog	1587499212	Lions	team	Good news! They have drafted some boy scouts compared to the Mayhew days.
fo46w2c	1587499217	Ravens	nfl	Romo and Nantz are in the car on the way to Romos surprise party. However Romo already knows what is coming.This is going to be so great Jim. We are going to walk in go up the stairs open the doors and everybody is going to pop out and yell surprise. Watch as I fake my reaction make it look real and have my wife come over to me and hug me and then have Jason Witten run a seam right to me. This is going to be awesome Jim. This is what you live for right? Jason Witten running a seam at your surprise party and then.. and then... arrives Here we go Jim!
fo46w44	1587499218	Buccaneers	team	Is this what happiness feels like?
fo46w4r	1587499218	Patriots	nfl	This would make sense to me. Bucs get a big piece to add to their win now mode, we get a young TE that can be part of our rebuild
fo46w6j	1587499219	Giants	nfl	Yeah
fo46w9y	1587499221	Jaguars	team	Oh Im with you 100. If one more fucker calls trying to buy oil Im gonna explode.
fo46vuf	1587499214	Falcons	team	While I agree I dont know. I feel confident its an accurate prediction.  If just one state could test every single person, I think the numbers would mimic my educated guess. Infrastructure is in place. Thats all we cant do. We cant wait it out, its not going away.
fo46vuj	1587499214	Buccaneers	nfl	I would love that with this personnel lol. Especially since right now they only have Ronald Jones in the backfield. Arians on the other hand...
fo46vzr	1587499217	Falcons	nfl	I dont know why youre getting downvoted but you are 100 percent right. We have a lot of holes in our roster which can be filled through the draft. Which is why Im worried about us trading up. If anything trading back, would be the smart move.
fo46w1v	1587499217	Buccaneers	team	I would hope so. They cant afford Gronk at the moment with their cap, so its not like they have a lot of leverage here.
fo46wc5	1587499221	Falcons	team	It isnt cherry picking though. It is going off of what information we currently have. No one has claimed any different, and that is how it always has worked. That is how it works with everything. We update numbers as new information is found out.

fo46x0g	1587499230	Broncos	team	I dont think focusing on high character players necessarily means they are less physical potential.  I do think it shortens the list tremendously.  20 players can have tons of talent but if you trimmed it to players with good heads on their shoulders, that list can be cut to 35 players.  But, this approach also includes avoiding the lowcharacter players so it looks like there is a good chance theyll miss out on talent from the outside looking in.  I dont believe the team is valuing good character that much over talent.  I think they are putting more value on good character along with talent.  Maybe a formula or equation to it?  (Im asking, not saying)Highcharacter  hightalent  production, coachable, growthhighcharacter  averagetalent  some production, coachable, growthlowcharacter  hightalent  production, not as coachable, no growthlowcharacter  lowtalent  no production, not coachable, no growth

fo46wss	1587499227	Eagles	nfl	Okay let me tell you all the reasons on why a kicker should never be taken in a high round. After this I would like to see your reasoning because all you do is dick off and prove no knowledge of football at all whatsoever. Kickers have long careers, so of course they score a lot of points. Every touch down scored, they get a point. That adds up. Plus field goals. A player scoring a touch down is much less common then a kicker scoring. If a running back gets a touch down, thats 6 points, but they only score ever so often. A kickers career will last 2 or 3 times more than  a running back. Onto the next point, which is the draft. A kicker is only on the field for extra points kickoffs and field goal attempts. Compared to every other position (excluding special team exclusives), that is a very limited amount of time. Players in offense and defense play significantly more time. If you are using a high round draft pick, that person is most likely talented and has exhibited special skills. They will play much more on the field, meaning more value for that pick. Throughout history, kickers were never really taken high because there was no reason to. And if there was, GMs would do it, but they dont, because it would be idiotic and less beneficial for the team. Thats why taking a kicker in a high round is stupidly idiotic, and something the only stupidly idiotic GM would do, which is Bill OBrien, bringing me back to my original comment.

fo46xac	1587499234	Patriots	team	Wouldnt be surprised. Gronk left notsosubtle hints that dealing with Belichicks coaching style was bothering him. Then there was the report that they were going to ship him off to Detroit until Brady put his foot down and squashed it.
fo46x9p	1587499234	Buccaneers	nfl	At least take the pants you wear with your blue jerseys(httpscdn.voxcdn.comthumborxAsbklorOZOLHPTfiWUwVt7I833x04416x2922920x613filtersfocal(33x04416x2922)format(webp)cdn.voxcdn.comuploadschorusimageimage46387624usatoday8232917.0.jpg) and just make those the default.

fo46x9c	1587499234	Jaguars	nfl	Saban is the one coach you cant use this argument with because his offensive ideology is fluid. He always changes it to fit personnel, the moment he noticed how accurate brees was the offense wouldve been fine tailored to make him successful.

fo46xxv	1587499243	Redskins	team	We did rebuild, we also traded for Brad Johnson with those picks, and improved to 106 and won the NFC East.  It was only because in 2000 we decided to spend, spend, spend, in Free Agency, and then fire our 76 coach during the playoff push, which caused us to drop to 88, we then dumped some of our core players (Brad Johnson, James Thrash, Larry Centers, Mike Sellers, Skip Hicks, Stephen Alexander) the following year due to being in cap hell due to the spend spend spend mentality that we had.We actually built a good team for 1999, but blew it up because we had an impatient owner.
fo46xz4	1587499243	Patriots	team	They should give us all of their draft picks and Howard
fo46y2f	1587499245	Cardinals	nfl	In addition, if Gronk returns, i think he collapses New Englands cap. Tampa and Gronk could twist the knife IF they desired.
fo46y3l	1587499245	Ravens	team	Didnt address Guard..
fo46xvg	1587499242	Patriots	team	If they doing this deal I want OJ Howard, 2nd round or 3 round pick.
fo46y0i	1587499244	Chargers	team	So basically, he doesnt read stuff well enough because he doesnt come off of how he was taught to read the play, and throws it to his first read when the guy is open?  I just dont see how thats a knock on him, that he throws the play the way his coaches want him to.... Like I said, this seems like the perfect example of his coaches hamstringing him either with bad scheme, or bad teaching, because it SHOULD be read that way, but that doesnt mean he was taught to.Also I dont really think that he thew that ball in the wrong place.  The S already broke on that and took away the bullet.  Thats another one where it seems like a landmark throw.  He lofted both to the sideline, so Im betting thats just how they want him to throw that play.  But again, none of us know any of this and were both completely speculating to argue our points, so its pretty much a moot point. Honestly thats one detail that always annoys me about him.  Hes put like 34 hail mary balls into the crowd. Its insanely frustraing.  Is that what youre talking about.If you say that you dont see big ben flashes then go watch the Colorado game, or the Wazzu game. Hes fairly similar to Carson Wentz too.  But he just dominates those games. People are ridiculously out of control with this blind hating on Herbert.  Its ok to not like them and acknowledge that he plays well and shows flashes of greatness. If you dont see upside then you clearly are just not open to accepting that he can be good.
fo46y36	1587499245	Buccaneers	team	Fuck yesOne of my favorite players of all time playing for the bucs will be amazing
fo46y8b	1587499247	Vikings	nfl	 its a super deep class and his athleticism is a question markFor sure. Reminds me of Jarvis Landrylite. Not the same kind of agility, but you dont have to be a straight burner to have success. Ill be rooting for him, wherever he ends up.
fo46ybf	1587499248	Patriots	team	Fuck this is sort of best case scenerio right? If we could get OJ Howard for the rights to a retired guy that would be alltime.
fo46ydf	1587499249	Lions	team	Gotcha, do they practically add anything to the team other than depth?
fo46yeu	1587499250	Buccaneers	nfl	It seems more like Saban quit the NFL because he didnt want to deal with the players egos than the NFL quit on him because youre right. His final year with the Dolphins they started terribly but after he purged a bunch of the deadweight they actually made a serious push for the playoffs.Give Saban another year with the Dolphins and an actual QB and I think he gets them rolling.
fo46yfe	1587499250	Falcons	team	Ill take Matty Ice for 36 more seasons if we can form a solid ass team around him. This will ruin us so I say no. The window is now while Julio and Matt are at peak.
fo46yo7	1587499253	Buccaneers	team	The Tampa Bay Patriots strike again
fo46yq0	1587499254	Patriots	team	Technically, no, if I remember correctly. Because he is on reserve retire, it isnt on our cap, and thats something TB and Gronk would negotiate ala Marshawn and the raiders.
fo46yrh	1587499255	Jaguars	team	Drake no use full size laptops  Drake yes use Microsoft Surfaces with all the dongles
fo46yxd	1587499257	Falcons	team	Exactly. He truly wants to be here and his play is gonna reflect that

fo46zjm	1587499265	Patriots	team	All we need to be competitive is a Brady lite. Accurate short to mid range and not stupid. He probably isnt going to have the comeback kid magic that Tom did, and realistically we probably wont win the super bowl with him, but as long as he can stay cool in the pocket, read the defense, and hit his guys open we should be able to hit a 10 win season on the back of this defense as long as all our you offensive weapons start to develop
fo46zrq	1587499269	Chargers	team	I want to get a KA13 but hes a UFA next year. Should I gamble on him being resigned?
fo46zs9	1587499269	49ers	nfl	Its a bit disingenuous to make that comparison. Aldon is clearly pretty far in the process of making a real NFL comeback. Hes sober, in shape, and has signed with a team that seemingly has a reasonable support structure in place (has his old pal Jim Tom to coach him, and is naturally good playing next to Cowboys). As far as I know Justin Blackmon isnt doing anything.
fo46zkd	1587499266	Buccaneers	team	Yeah 2018 gave us a stud DT and a Starting cornerback in Davis

fo46zu6	1587499270	Patriots	team	Im in complete agreement that the silver helmet is out of place on the new uniforms. The jerseys should be designed around the helmet, because the helmet is not going to change. They said that they didnt want take from the old uniforms because they thought it would ruin the throwbacks integrity. Not saying that they are right or wrong, but that is what they said.Well get the throwbacks as an alternative next year, when the helmet rule changes.

fo471dn	1587499291	Panthers	team	There is literally no reason on earth to think Allen would have won that Colts game lolWhy not? We were pretty competitive in almost every game with Kyle behind center. We only got railroaded in like 2 of his starts. The Colts were able to get out to a quick start because Grier was no where close to being ready for big boy football. Before you turned around it was 213 at half. The benching of Kyle Allen assured we would lose. I think the players knew it too because special teams gave up 2 punt returns for a TD. It isnt crazy to think we could have beaten the Colts. They were a mess last year.
fo471jr	1587499293	Redskins	team	Its not impossible, just unlikely. The fact that Trent has been sitting there for a year and a half tells you something.

fo471kk	1587499293	Patriots	team	Probably because he seemingly wants to go to a run first offense to help a young QB progress, and he drafted a 62 225 lb WR in the first round who(fingers crossed) can take a step up and be an unmissable target for a young QB, AND has put together a nasty defense to, again, help a young QB

The SEC just has flat out better athletes and jeudy was going against that week in and week out. I dont want to make it seem like Im shitting on lamb because I think he will be a good pro player. But the question asked was who do you prefer and if its him vs jeudy, Im taking jeudy.

fo472vl	1587499311	49ers	team	2017 and 2018 were rebuilding years with Lynch and Shanahan publicly mentioning they were playing with house money. With the success in 2019, they have now buckled down in their approach with cap management  restructuring McKinnon, trading Buckner for a top 15 draft pick, and extending key players (e.g. Ward, Armstead) with cap flexibility terms. I dont think the RB situation is unique. Teams that overpay for free agents generally dont see the output to justify the cost  regardless of position. And credit to the 49ers for being able to demonstrate a sustainable rushing attack with diversity in the backfield.
fo472ze	1587499313	Bills	nfl	Because Arians has a hard enough time getting one TE involved in their offense and he already has shown a preference for Brate over Howard

fo473hl	1587499320	Lions	nfl	Yeah, I do agree with that. I think the trade down situation adds a degree of volatility this year, but I think the Lions must love Okudah. The question is, do they love him enough to pass up extra picks? The dream scenario remains trading to five, getting at least an extra second (and hopefully Miamis third first rounder) and taking Okudah anyway
fo473f7	1587499319	Bears	team	Complete hot take that I know will be wildly unpopular. Jim McMahon is overrated by this fanbase
fo4741d	1587499327	Giants	nfl	Why does reddit think Yellowstone is bound to blow up any minute now?  Was there something posted on the site a while back that said so?  Having read a lot on the subject, people need to chill on the 2020 doomsday stuff.
fo474au	1587499330	Seahawks	nfl	The rule is currently 1 shell, the facemask can be detached and replaced
fo473pz	1587499323	Vikings	team	If it wasnt clear, that 412 Cowboys team I mentioned was their 2015 team.They had 3 all pros starting on their OL (Travis Frederick, Zack Martin, Tyron Smith). The other two positions were Lael Collins and Doug Free, who both had strong seasons with a grade of 68 and 69 from PFF
fo474ea	1587499332	Lions	team	Unless its a team trying to trade ahead of the chargers or the dolphins knowing the lions only want to drop to 5 or 6
fo474g9	1587499332	Patriots	team	We just need to get BoB to mediate the trade on behalf of Tampa and I think that could happen.
fo4743t	1587499328	Lions	nfl	How does the Redskins passing on Young mean he goes to the Giants?
fo4748e	1587499329	Vikings	nfl	The virgin Bill BelichickThe CHAD Bruce Arians
fo474sc	1587499337	Panthers	nfl	at least he has chicken
fo474gf	1587499332	Jets	nfl	Gronk coming back into the league after winning a WWE championship has to be the most Gronk thing ever
fo474rg	1587499336	Panthers	nfl	Ummm but Bruce Arians doesnt know what a TE is
fo474ry	1587499337	Texans	team	I want all white, all red, and all blue unis. Solid colors top and bottom moving forward with matching helmets.
fo474zj	1587499340	Broncos	nfl	boop
fo474sy	1587499337	Patriots	nfl	Pats should trade for that Brady guy
fo47566	1587499342	Seahawks	team	I was at this game with my friends we got trashed.
fo4759r	1587499344	Chargers	nfl	OJ Howard and the 2nd round pick rob Gronk
fo474tg	1587499337	Patriots	nfl	Hell yeah. He isnt going to play for us whatever we can get is a win.
fo4752e	1587499341	Eagles	team	The easy answer would be to run less 12 personnel. You think that guys like juju or thielen would sit on the bench bc of goeddert? Now if youre saying that you think that Jefferson can ONLY be effective in the slot, then I hear you. But if its a case of him being better in the slot but serviceable on the outside a few times a game, then Im good with him as our guy. I just dont want then to overthink it and pass on a better player bc theyre fixated on outside wrs
fo475dw	1587499345	Eagles	nfl	Thats true, but I think RB is being devalued by NFL teams significantly from year to year. A RB was viewed much more valuable in 2018 than it was 2020, thats how quickly the league is evolving. At least thats how I see it
fo475er	1587499346	Ravens	nfl	Dont act like he just got here though and multiple teams werent attempting to poach him as GM.
fo475h4	1587499347	Packers	nfl	Prolly not. Since Rodgers got drafted the Packers have been more successful than the 49ers
fo475ke	1587499348	Falcons	nfl	Very well done.The Chargers might not have many fans show up, but theyre definitely a team I would root for if I was a foreigner just arriving in America, and had to pick a team.x200BGreat name. Great logo. Great Uniforms.
fo47574	1587499343	Jaguars	team	Right there with you. Give me all of the offense.
fo475c4	1587499345	Saints	nfl	FUCK
fo475id	1587499347	Rams	team	Its really starting to feel like thats their plan. You havent heard a peep out of the organization about the unis. I wouldnt be surprised if they dropped them low key as fuck Thursday morning so the backlash gets drowned out by the draft.
fo4754j	1587499342	Cardinals	nfl	Patriots. TB has leverage. If Gronk returns, I believe it would further deplete the patriots cap.
fo475tz	1587499352	Ravens	team	Hes also been called the smartest guy on the defense by guys like TJ and Earl Thomas. Even though we havent really gotten to see him in action last offseason the players were hyping him up as our dark horse star defender
fo475nq	1587499349	Patriots	nfl	httpstwitter.compatscapstatus1252687436494315525
fo4760q	1587499354	Redskins	team	Well, we werent trying to trade him for most of that time so that logic is pretty flawed. Especially since its rumored the Browns offered their first round pick (and I will never forgive Bruce Allen for not taking that)
fo4761s	1587499355	Eagles	team	The dude was in town for a fucking weekend. As a tourist.Its okay that Mims found Philly scary because hes young guy from a small town in Texas, and it is an intimidating place at first. I dont think that makes him mentally weak or whatever. But Philly isnt actually fucking scary. Sure, maybe if youre wandering Strawberry Mansion after dark, but for the most part its a safe, awesome place. Dont tear down the city like that.
fo475yk	1587499353	Patriots	team	Move on man. Enough of the pity party boys!
fo4761a	1587499354	Patriots	team	Maybe unpopular opinion but this blows. Sucks that theyre both gonna be playing for another team
fo47673	1587499357	Jaguars	nfl	Usually for that you need handcuffs, rope, and a riding crop
fo47626	1587499355	Seahawks	team	Its not anecdotes dude its game experience. Football is made up of 22 different players wit different talents and skills, using different schemes every time, trying to get in each others heads. They play 16 games a year which is countless different combinations of these unique individuals going against each other. You cant break all that down into a couple of charts and say see running the ball doesnt impact the outcome of your offense. What I can trust is the countless people who actually play the game saying yes running the ball is helpful toward opening up our gameplanNow Pete Carroll if definitely stubborn but not because he thinks running is good, but because hes not willing to deviate. The patriots do it best when its suits them to run more they run a lot but they can also come out and throw it 50 times if the defense is over playing the run.
fo4762k	1587499355	49ers	nfl	Schefter  God
fo476ks	1587499362	Vikings	team	It sounds like Washington wont move out of their pick except for an RGIII level deal, so Im betting on them taking Young and Detroit or NYG moving back with one of LACMIA for a QB. From all the rumors, the draft starts at pick 3.
fo476l4	1587499362	Patriots	team	It be the most Belichick trade of all time and Im here for it lol.
fo476dt	1587499359	Lions	team	Ford played a few decent games in 2018 but hasnt shown much since. Virgin hasnt really shown much at all ever. Both are unlikely to make it to the final roster, especially if we draft a CB on day 1 or 2.
fo476in	1587499361	Patriots	team	OH FUCK OFF
fo476kf	1587499362	Seahawks	team	Hes literally just as good, plus and extra enzie
fo476lu	1587499362	Patriots	nfl	At least Schefter is giving credit to the original source unless Crapoport
fo476v8	1587499366	Raiders	team	Wood is my dad.
fo476om	1587499364	Broncos	nfl	 WOW
fo476ru	1587499365	Falcons	team	Dont get me wrong, I want you to be right, I am just really skeptical of any predictions this early. I mean there is already research suggesting it has already evolved into 20 new strains. Viruses are really fucky.
fo47710	1587499368	Giants	nfl	NFC South in shambles.
fo47745	1587499370	Buccaneers	nfl	Howard for Gronk and a picky?
fo477dy	1587499374	Titans	nfl	Well considering what has happened so far, would it really be that important?
fo477f1	1587499374	Broncos	nfl	As a Broncos fan, those things are INCREDIBLE!
fo477iq	1587499375	Panthers	nfl	God dammit
fo477k0	1587499376	Bengals	nfl	Never attempt to spell Cincinnati again
fo477ky	1587499376	Patriots	team	You and me both.
fo477dh	1587499374	Eagles	nfl	Schefter just tweeted at Leroy saying he was right.
fo477j5	1587499376	Panthers	nfl	Good guy Schefter
fo477sq	1587499379	Vikings	nfl	Yah, if I want to make changes I can do that from just an ingredient list and the cooking steps at the end.
fo477z4	1587499381	Patriots	team	With what leverage? Hes a retired player that wants to play elsewhere. You cant exactly demand the farm.Im guessing OJ Howard and a 2nd or 3rd
fo477vm	1587499380	Patriots	nfl	any sane Patriots fan would be thrilled with this trade.
fo477z7	1587499381	Saints	nfl	FUCK
fo477vq	1587499380	Seahawks	team	Bizarrely late reply I know, I just noticed my phone keeps my comment drafts and I realize I never submitted this one Small sample analytics? Its not even a sample its literally every sack over the 4 games hes analyzing.
fo478c0	1587499386	Lions	team	I dont think hes risky, but I dont have him over Thomas and Wills. He is a good prospect but I dont think he is an elite prospect. As an interior OL playing RG I think he will be very good, but as an RT he will be good. LT...yeah just dont do that to the guy.
fo478kb	1587499390	Seahawks	team	no it does not This is just not true.
fo47850	1587499384	Titans	team	Henry had a higher YPA rushing. Not to mention he even missed 1 more game than Chubb...
fo4787a	1587499385	49ers	nfl	Gronkowski off the top rope
fo4789d	1587499385	Panthers	nfl	Started 70 games and scored 60 tds
fo478f4	1587499388	Patriots	team	Id do it to move up 9 spots and get OJ Howard

fo478wa	1587499394	Vikings	team	Im perfectly confident in Kubiak and Dennison
fo4793u	1587499397	Patriots	nfl	The value is going to be close to 0Like a 7th
fo4796c	1587499398	Colts	nfl	MAKE IT STOP
fo478sz	1587499393	Broncos	nfl	Im thinking more like a 6th.  You guys are joking right?
fo47907	1587499395	Panthers	nfl	The worst fucking year in the history of the world.
fo47955	1587499397	Eagles	team	Unless shes sending pics or throwing herself around at people with inside knowledge when they are in Philly, she doesnt have any sources. Hate to be that guy... but lets be real shes a nobody
fo478q2	1587499392	49ers	nfl	Hes missed a year of football after playing the sport his entire life. You really think this freak of nature wouldnt be able to get back to his old self after a few months of intense physical training? Hell he might be even fresher after letting his body recover.
fo478r9	1587499392	Seahawks	nfl	Hes never thrown for more than 14 TDs in a season, so 1616 would actually be above average for him hahahaha. God, I have absolutely no faith in that guy, what do people see in him?!
fo478wi	1587499394	Broncos	nfl	Lol Im a sucker, and Id get that jersey
fo4792a	1587499396	Bills	nfl	Hoyt make it to choke them away! At least our most impressive choke job was in the SUPER BOWL and not in the divisional game. Also weve never given up a 240 lead to lose a game
fo479h5	1587499402	Buccaneers	nfl	MY BODY IS READY
fo479h9	1587499402	Cowboys	nfl	Damn Im used to thinking all these new jerseys are let downs, but wow I really like these
fo479k3	1587499403	Patriots	team	Theres no way we get pick number 14 for it right?
fo479lt	1587499404	Giants	nfl	Gronkowski is due 10M this year and the Patriots have 1M in cap space before signing their picks.They have to get rid of him
fo479su	1587499407	Jets	team	I really like this mock. I wouldnt mind taking Okudah if he fell to us
fo479v2	1587499407	Panthers	nfl	I cant wait for it to be warm enough at night that I dont feel the need to bring in my 12 plants.
fo47a1l	1587499410	Falcons	team	Got damn it
fo47a7a	1587499412	Chargers	nfl	I thought for sure I would underwhelmed given he hype... but the navy color rush are lit
fo479ve	1587499407	Patriots	nfl	Only for OJ Howard
fo47a0d	1587499409	Jaguars	nfl	Sounds fatal
fo47aaz	1587499413	Patriots	nfl	The Chiefs and Ravens are successful when the Rams faltered because they improved their D over the same time period. The Rams on paper had so much talent defensively, along with Wade, and it was surprising to me that they didnt live up to it.
fo47a1o	1587499410	Patriots	team	Were gonna need a megathread for this. Eithe way, happy for Gronk for coming back (I knew he would), just wish it were with us. Not sad about it. I get it. He doesnt want do things Bellichicks way. Hes done it long enough.
fo47a3c	1587499411	Patriots	nfl	And good boy Leroy
fo47a3u	1587499411	Patriots	nfl	OJ is already a hall of famer for the Bills
fo47agn	1587499415	Lions	team	Thanks for the insight!
fo47a8i	1587499412	Buccaneers	team	Cant afford him and I dont think hed play for them. Good news for us
fo47a9w	1587499413	Eagles	team	Big time fuck that guy
fo47alv	1587499417	Lions	team	There is a significant difference between 64 240 and 61 240. Its not a knock on the dude that he is not a MLB at the next level. If you watch his tape, he can get washed out of the inside on run plays. Even one inch difference has a major affect on the weight need to play a position.
fo47aog	1587499418	Jaguars	nfl	Gronk will be unstoppable as long as he can smoke the weeds.
fo47akp	1587499416	Titans	nfl	I avoid that like the plague. Also hardly any Snapchat either. Im not a fan of narcissism.
fo47aos	1587499418	Buccaneers	team	Belicheck OJ Howard for Gronk
fo47aqm	1587499419	Buccaneers	nfl	The stars are aligning...
fo47asr	1587499419	Patriots	nfl	Gronk has always said there was a chance hed unretire. A year off and the NFL relaxing rules on drug testing are probably both big difference makers for him
fo47avx	1587499421	Bills	nfl	Thats WWE Champion Gronk
fo47b00	1587499422	Eagles	team	Tom Brady has 6 SBs by working the middle of the field though.
fo47b7f	1587499425	Buccaneers	nfl	Man, every other team in the NFC South can have a seat and take it. Weve had to deal with Cam Newton, Drew Brees, and Matt Ryan for the past decade. You guys can tolerate a couple years of the corpses of Brady and Gronk lol.
fo47axu	1587499422	Rams	team	Wow.  Thats REALLY terrible.
fo47ay1	1587499422	Bears	team	cond 7 lol
fo47b0k	1587499423	Patriots	nfl	Johnny Manziel
fo47b2c	1587499423	Panthers	nfl	I mean at least Bruce Arians has been bad with utilizing TEs, right?Right?
fo47b5b	1587499425	Steelers	nfl	The NFL really gave that up? Man, Josh Gordon has got to be pissed.
fo47bpu	1587499432	Jaguars	team	Hang in there friend
fo47b32	1587499424	Chargers	nfl	Actually, I grew up in SD and Utah. So thats why those two teams. Red Sox started because I hated the Yankees with a passion, so liking the Red Sox came natural.
fo47bhf	1587499429	Browns	team	If I remember correctly, all official jersey stores are doing it. Infinitely better turnaround from our stadium, however!

fo47c2q	1587499437	Giants	nfl	Its not popular to disagree with the point youre trying to make, but Ill do it anyway. This is completely apples and oranges as far as comparisons go. Peyton Manning was drafted to a terrible Colts team who had been in constant rebuild mode for much of the 90s. People viewed them like they were a worse version of the current Texans (ignoring the recent idiocy of BoB even). They could go 88 or 97 in the division, maybe win a wild card game, but no one took them seriously as a contender. Peyton Manning changed that perception comprehensively and was being labeled a top QB in the league before he took the field. The team and organization he played for werent great without him, and some seasons were just outright bad. Compare that with Baltimore who hasnt been able to field a bad defense in 2 decades, is never out of the playoff hunt in any season, and is frequently viewed as the kryptonite to the best dynasty in sports history. Flacco was struggling and the offense couldnt get out of their own way before Lamar took over, but he still did so with an extremely stable organization and perennial contender team. Peyton also was viewed as great playing as a traditional QB who showed the ability to master every single prototypical QB trait. That is the oppose of how Lamar has done it. Im aware he led the league in TD throws last year, but even knowing that Im not aware of anyone who thinks he is a great traditional passer in the way Russ, Mahomes, the various other young guys out there are. He makes plays that no one since Vick has made and its not clear how long he will be able to do that. Is it fair to call him a gimmick? Probably not. But its also not realistic to say you can compare his lack of playoff success to the lack of success Manning had early on considering theres nothing else similar about their environments other than both being one and done in their first two attempts.
fo47brx	1587499433	Patriots	team	Randy Moss announces his unretirement to join the Bucs.
fo47bud	1587499434	49ers	nfl	Yeah we tend to go for BPA so nothing would surprise me there. Im hoping for WROT though, at 13 we should get top talent to either of those and or offense needs impact players there.
fo47bvi	1587499434	Falcons	team	I trust Debo to handle him, but we might need another speedy LB if this is true.
fo47c2f	1587499437	Falcons	nfl	MEGA FUCK
fo47c4e	1587499438	Saints	nfl	CUT MY LIFE INTO PIECES
fo47cm5	1587499444	Titans	nfl	He is living in 3020. He saw it coming
fo47c7q	1587499439	Giants	nfl	Yea super expensive.  My salary will be good but yikes.
fo47ch4	1587499442	Browns	nfl	I mean thats up to the player to keep in shape and hold himself accountable. Your a fucking professional, you shouldnt need a babysitter. And yes I remember Dez Bryant basically having a paid babysitter courtesy of the Cowboys.
fo47cth	1587499447	Patriots	team	 I was fine with Gronk retiring to protect his health because I love the guy but now he wants to play again?...I mean the state of the offenses between the patriots and the bucs are completely different... If Gronk played last year he would have gotten double teamed every single route that he ran.  Tampas offense is so loaded though that you cant really afford to double team him.  He probably likes the idea of playing in a good offense where he can take on a smaller role.
fo47cz5	1587499449	Buccaneers	nfl	2020 starting to seem like a whole different dimension at this point
fo47cch	1587499440	Lions	team	As long as he says This is my private domicile and I wont be harassed he should be ok.
fo47ccg	1587499440	Giants	nfl	His first 23 years with the chargers didnt show that though. They were moving on and it made sense when they brought in Rivers
fo47cdq	1587499441	Lions	nfl	Tampa Baytriots
fo47cew	1587499441	Eagles	nfl	Has to be a joke.. right?.. please?
fo47cgh	1587499442	Bears	team	It would be a really dumb move to fire him. Any incoming GM is going to have to be a cap expert. Why would you want to come into cash strapped Chicago without any tradable assets? Pace AND Nagy both deserve another year (barring any more bone head moves.)
fo47cig	1587499443	Patriots	nfl	FROM THE TOP ROPE
fo47cll	1587499444	Falcons	nfl	No pls
fo47d38	1587499450	Patriots	team	Ill probably get downvoted for this, but honestly fuck gronk.
fo47d91	1587499453	Texans	nfl	Yeah people dont realize how great Romo actually was and thats OK because it adds to the speech hell give when he gets in the broadcasting HoF in thirty years.
fo47dah	1587499453	Raiders	nfl	What gives Tampa Bay the right to be good all of a sudden?
fo47daf	1587499453	Vikings	team	Nearly guaranteed theyre better than Boyd
fo47dli	1587499458	Panthers	nfl	He also said the Pats would sign Cam
fo47dnx	1587499458	Patriots	nfl	This was all preplanned...
fo47d5n	1587499451	Giants	nfl	 The Patriots leverage is saying no. They have nothing to lose and only potential to gain.How do they find the 10M to pay Gronkowski?
fo47dpz	1587499459	Falcons	nfl	I dont like this.
fo47dme	1587499458	Falcons	nfl	Well Brady didnt go to Tampa to enjoy the beaches and sunsets. Unfortunate the Bucs are in our division, because with the Panthers dormant, I was hoping the Saints would be the only team to hurdle.
fo47dm7	1587499458	Bears	nfl	Tampa Baytriots
fo47du7	1587499461	Patriots	team	I feel betrayed by this whole offseason. Fuck this all
fo47dw1	1587499461	Patriots	team	0 chance
fo47e3r	1587499464	Chiefs	nfl	yeah thats on purpose. Because Color Rush unis are ugly and stupid
fo47e5n	1587499465	Bears	nfl	rjesuschristreddit
fo47ds7	1587499460	Packers	nfl	That didnt end well last time
fo47dvl	1587499461	Patriots	nfl	Kmet has a high ceiling Ill give him that. He certainly could develop into a Y TE but you can flex him into the slot right away.
fo47dxi	1587499462	Giants	nfl	This is just stupid
fo47e1b	1587499463	Raiders	nfl	If this happens I think the Bucs should be generally favored to win the NFC.
fo47e2g	1587499464	Patriots	nfl	Yes but I dont want to see Gronk in any other jersey.  It will already hurt enough to see our boy in another home, we cant let them take our dog too
fo47e8x	1587499466	Panthers	nfl	 Exactly 70Thats well above average
fo47ei6	1587499470	Jaguars	team	Exactly my point. We didnt tag him therefore he wasnt held hostage which is how Yannick is acting. He (Robinson) didnt want to be here and his exit was quiet and pretty uneventful. To be clear I dont give a shit how Yannick feels about this. He doesnt want to be here. The team is doing nothing wrong with tagging him and holding him until they feel they get what they want for him.
fo47dz5	1587499463	Patriots	nfl	Yea, my first inkling was to say probably a midround pick AT BEST
fo47e7e	1587499465	Eagles	team	Loveee this guy for us assuming we get the receiver we want. A bit raw but hes an athletic freeak, look at that size and speed. If his production level matched his talent hed easily be a 1st round pick.
fo47eb2	1587499467	Patriots	team	Isnt it tricky for the pats to get a good haul for gronk? Hes due like 10ish mil and the pats definitely dont have that so it seems like gronk has a good amount of leverage right?
fo47ew8	1587499475	Buccaneers	team	I agree, but up until the meltdown during the last few weeks it was very much in question.I was always in the franchise Shaq, and lowball Jameis camp. Dont think we even lowballed Jameis though.
fo47eie	1587499470	Raiders	nfl	Gronk wants to play again!! Wow 
fo47enf	1587499472	Patriots	team	Thats a lot considering the lack of leverage. However I would be so happy with that return
fo47evz	1587499475	49ers	team	Pick an immediate impact player at 13, and trade away 31 for more capital on days 2 and 3.We need to replace DBuck and Sanders use 13 to pick up one of those.
fo47f24	1587499478	Broncos	nfl	There it is. Retirement lost their guy
fo47f46	1587499478	Colts	team	Jalen Hurts is exactly like Brissett except for his mobility. He holds the ball too long, has trouble reading defenses, doesnt go through his reads properly, and is late on a lot of his passes.
fo47f5q	1587499479	Buccaneers	team	Ive never felt more empty inside. 
fo47f78	1587499479	Patriots	team	My sources are telling me gronk and a 4th for Godwin, oj, and Derrick brooks
fo47f0x	1587499477	Patriots	team	You are vastly overrating the TE options in this draft my friend.
fo47f1i	1587499477	Cowboys	team	Agreed.  I just see CB and S as much more pressing needs. We can always get a center next year, Looney is fine.
fo47f05	1587499477	Titans	nfl	This timeline is so spicy
fo47f4b	1587499478	Patriots	nfl	Appreciate any feedback you have to give reddit.
fo47f5h	1587499479	Patriots	nfl	OH COME ON
fo47fbk	1587499481	Redskins	team	Also, if he sits out he still gets paid.
fo47fdz	1587499482	Patriots	nfl	And hes a very good boy
fo47fla	1587499485	Patriots	nfl	He was the still the best tight end in the league until the 2018 season.
fo47fmi	1587499486	Patriots	team	Gronk and Thuney for OJ Howard a 2nd and a 4th
fo47fu0	1587499488	Patriots	nfl	As a pats fan...Im rooting for the Bucs until tom and gronk retire if this goes through haha.
fo47fux	1587499489	Raiders	nfl	Oh jeeesus
fo47fac	1587499481	Packers	team	Fax. Say every possible thing with the slightest chance of happening so then you get treated like a god if one does happen
fo47fh2	1587499483	Jaguars	team	Yeah okay, Ill sling a gold on this.
fo47fk3	1587499484	Dolphins	nfl	 unrelated conversations    Nay  nothing is unrelated.  All things serve the beam.
fo47fkz	1587499485	Patriots	team	Dude wtf
fo47fmp	1587499486	Buccaneers	team	Holy shit
fo47frs	1587499487	Patriots	team	Thatd be a QB and OJ but zero picks till round 3
fo47fsx	1587499488	Patriots	team	Nah, fuck parcells. Dont honor people who stab you in the back.
fo47fu5	1587499488	Redskins	nfl	Brady definitely trying to get the band back together.
fo47fsr	1587499488	Patriots	team	New England having a ridiculously good run is not exclusive with New England having poor draft classes.Yes it is. It is not possible to have the sustained success the Patriots have had without getting significant contributions through the draft, and the Patriots have done so regardless of whether you think theyre sexy enough.
fo47fus	1587499489	Jets	team	little of Ramsey, little of Clowney, little of Mosley, little of ETIII, and a little of Honey Badger and you get what Jamal Adams is. Def worth it.
fo47g0y	1587499491	Buccaneers	team	Gronk will singlehandedly erase any economic losses from coronavirus.
fo47g7o	1587499494	Steelers	nfl	Ive said this every year for several years but the curse is only believable if you are willing to overlook all the times nothing happened
fo47g9b	1587499494	Falcons	team	Just commented on the other post, but you dont think another LB to help Debo would make sense?
fo47gef	1587499496	Falcons	nfl	A happy Gronk smoking weed?This is the worst timeline.
fo47ghz	1587499498	Patriots	team	I want both OJ Howard and a second. Mostly because this one hurts.
fo47fxt	1587499490	Packers	nfl	Theres nothing worse the reason from a person you want to hate.  I definitely feel you here.
fo47fxz	1587499490	Panthers	nfl	Do you have a source? Because it makes no sense to think that Tepper would throw all this money and a 7 year deal at a new coach and then not let him roll with the players he wants. Its speculation either way because we have no way of knowing what they have said but the logical answer is that Rhule didnt want Cam or Greg, so Cam and Greg are gone. Not that Tepper hired the most wanted coach in the offseason to be a puppet and ignore him completely.
fo47fy6	1587499490	Patriots	team	Might as well, the pats own his rights. Ill be pissed as fuck if we dont end up with some good compensation
fo47g46	1587499492	Seahawks	nfl	you will definitely enjoy it. the chicken friedcountry fried steak is also a big win
fo47ghq	1587499498	Patriots	team	I mean if they really want gronk, they have to give something. 2nd is more likely, because I think he does still have more in the tank, but I want Bill to be a hard ass. Gronk is technically ours for a year. If he wants to play, its on TB to pay up.
fo47g36	1587499492	Buccaneers	team	Same here lmaoo
fo47g4i	1587499492	Buccaneers	team	Im excited for the draft.
fo47g76	1587499493	Jaguars	team	Gronk and Brady? If they can get one of the top 4 tackles, itll be game over.
fo47gfy	1587499497	Bills	nfl	They dont have to accept him onto their roster if he unretires though iirc. Also I doubt hell actually file for reinstatement unless his rights are traded
fo47gc5	1587499495	Giants	nfl	How is he a legend? He isnt top 3 cowboys qb ever. He went to the playoffs 4x in 10 years, has 2 playoff wins(1 which was gifted by the refs, lions game) never been to the nfc championship game. So where does legend fit?Legends in case you dont know areMontanaBradyElwayUnitasP ManningFavreBradshawStarrStaubachAnd the likesYoure saying romo is in the same category?
fo47gpw	1587499501	Patriots	nfl	Gimme
fo47gwb	1587499503	Patriots	nfl	Oh. Well its still a draft pick!
fo47gje	1587499498	Vikings	nfl	Yeah, that seems pretty reasonable to me. A win for all sides.
fo47gpn	1587499501	Chargers	team	I feel like Tua and Simmons wont be there for us, and most people on this sub will be disappointed in the pick no matter who we get at that point.
fo47gtn	1587499502	Bengals	nfl	Not enough defense or Oline to do what San Fran did last year. Maybe if they absolutely nail the next two drafts.
fo47gwz	1587499503	Giants	nfl	True but we have London games
fo47gun	1587499502	Patriots	team	Yeah,I was just thinking about this.Toms departure was devastating however, I got over gronks after the second week of,Im coming back. a minute later too.. Im retired hehe just kidding!
fo47h2y	1587499506	Vikings	nfl	Oh, they certainly have the right to protest. Im disagreeing with their issue for protesting in the first place. Not their right to do so.
fo47h6a	1587499507	Titans	nfl	A 1 overall bust?
fo47h0e	1587499505	Buccaneers	team	Gronk was always THE guy in New England. Hed get to be the third option in Tampa. That offense would be unstoppable
fo47h2d	1587499505	Eagles	nfl	The substance wasnt the issue. Dude is an addict.
fo47h6o	1587499507	Patriots	nfl	Not sure what you mean, we almost certainly offered a 2nd for Howard last year and couldnt get it done. If we can do Gronk for Howard straight up we 100 should do that. There are still multiple teams that need TEs so we are basically guaranteed to not get a good one in this draft. It cannot be overstated how important it is for us to get a TE any way we can because we have no idea when we will have a chance again
fo47hmf	1587499513	Vikings	team	This just in Rick Spielman trades both first round picks, for 3 5th round picks. because more picks
fo47huu	1587499516	49ers	nfl	Im convinced if we drafted Rodgers instead hed be a whole lot worse than he is now. Alex Smith was put through the meat grinder and as soon as he had a good coach we made it to the NFC championship.
fo47hwm	1587499517	Rams	team	This isnt it. This has been floating around for a while
fo47hz1	1587499518	Buccaneers	team	This is really happening... unbelievable. This offense is something for the record books
fo47hzm	1587499518	Redskins	team	Im sure the Redskins are very high on the list of teams hed want to play for. We just shipped Dunbar out and are trying to get rid of Trent. No way do we need a drama queen like this on the team.
fo47hh0	1587499511	Panthers	nfl	They cant be good. They cant be. Im not in denial
fo47hm0	1587499513	Patriots	nfl	Lost all respect for Gronk. This is disgusting.
fo47hoe	1587499514	Buccaneers	nfl	Oj wont be good in a BB scheme. Dude just isnt that smart.
fo47hrb	1587499515	Buccaneers	team	Gronks contract with the patriots is only 1 year for 10 million. So if we got that the Bucs will have to move on from OJ (I personally dont like that idea)
fo47htr	1587499516	Jets	team	Yeah Id be pissed at first but Id get over it real quick knowing we have an instant starter at a position of need.
fo47hxo	1587499517	Buccaneers	team	Oh fuck Im hard
fo47i1g	1587499519	Patriots	team	He won something like 98 of his pass block matchups last year. Ill take a double shot of that please.
fo47i4x	1587499520	Falcons	team	I dont think we need to stop with the infrastructure, and as long as people have somewhere to go if sick thats good enough. Its better to let people get it and move on. We cannot prevent it. Like you said, its already mutated over and over. Killing the economy is only going to increase crime and suicide.
fo47id1	1587499523	Bears	team	You have me thinking, can teams trade picks that far in advance?
fo47ied	1587499524	Patriots	team	How is it a betrayal by Gronk? We cant afford him if he unretired, and if he does were getting something out of him, rather than if he stayed retired.
fo47ifz	1587499524	Patriots	team	I love Gronk but I dont think his number gets retired anyways.  Bradys 12 is the only number Id actually take issue with if given to a new player.
fo47ikt	1587499526	Titans	nfl	Not sure why youre being downvoted. Everytime you see ultra wires posted to rBattlestations or pcmasterrace or wherever else, the conversation inevitably turns to ultrawides vs dual monitors. Plenty of people who made the swap to ultrawides have said they miss having two monitors (rather than having to screen split and mess with whatever app is doing it) and plenty have ended up using dual ultrawides, or ultrawides flanked by standard monitors (either in portrait or landscape mode).I think right now the breakdown is basically to get an ultra wide if you mostly want to do super immersive gaming. But if youre going to be using multiple applications  even gaming on one monitor with discordSpotifybrowser on the other  youll probably still be happier with dualtriple monitors. Especially because its still probably cheaper to get higher refresh rates in your multiple monitors than getting a 4K monitor about 60hz. And if youre getting an ultra wide that is either a) below 144 Hz or b) not 4K  whats the point?
fo47imn	1587499527	Chiefs	nfl	Did anyone think it would be anyone other than Lamar? The only other person I could see it being is CMC.
fo47imv	1587499527	Patriots	team	I like this.
fo47i96	1587499522	Buccaneers	team	He wanted anything available but Jameis sounds like.
fo47ien	1587499524	Eagles	nfl	FUCK!
fo47ikl	1587499526	Raiders	team	During this time, please no more amateur mock drafts
fo47iou	1587499528	Patriots	team	He owes them a year on his contract...  I will be interesting to see what the Patriots do  they could be hardasses about it and demand a ransom (1st rounder or something) or let him go for whatever and move on.    Of course the spiteful bastard in me says demand it and fuck off if they dont pay but the pragmatic approach is to take a reasonable deal.
fo47iqb	1587499528	Buccaneers	team	Is it though? Why wouldnt you at least try to run 2TE sets with Gronk and OJ?
fo47idk	1587499523	49ers	team	Dont let Mitch catch you in the streets for this one
fo47ism	1587499529	Panthers	team	Lmao were about to face TB12 and Gronk twice a year and NE is going to somehow walk out of this with Tua and OJ Howard for the next decade
fo47j1f	1587499533	Buccaneers	team	God I dont know how to feel about this if it happens.On the one hand its Gronk and he could very well return to form after finally getting healthy.On the other hand he has a LONG injury history and his last couple seasons were definitely not on the same level of play were used to from him largely because of his injury history. Plus this likely would mean OJ is gone and we never get a chance to see if OJ could develop into the premier TE we drafted him to be.Fuck man I dunno thats tough
fo47irl	1587499529	Broncos	nfl	Time of his lifeVance Joseph has entered the chat
fo47iw2	1587499531	Buccaneers	team	What red flags other than injury concerns? Gronk is the complete package as a tight end, a freak of nature and has a legendary rapport with Brady
fo47j6b	1587499535	Lions	team	You have more hope than you think.  If we dont draft Young or Okudah this sub will implode.
fo47j6m	1587499535	Patriots	team	its not like he never played here. Itd be fun to watch them during our rebuilding year, and its not like itll outshine their time with the pats
fo47j7l	1587499535	Lions	nfl	Surely this will be the biggest news of the day.
fo47j8c	1587499535	Cardinals	team	     uMrChipKelly    
fo47ipu	1587499528	Patriots	team	Thatd be kind of dope doe..
fo47izf	1587499532	Jets	nfl	Cant wait until hes about to score to get the Bucs into the super bowl and Otis comes out of nowhere slamming his ass to win the 247 title.
fo47j6j	1587499535	Cardinals	nfl	Is he self aware?
fo47jan	1587499536	Packers	nfl	Agreed.  Would be weird to do a rebrand right after winning the super bowl.
fo47j0c	1587499532	Patriots	team	Such a weak move. I mean, at least we would get some compensation out of it, but come on. Dicked us around last offseason, retired too late to sign a free agent like cook, now hes demanding a trade to play with Tom? Come the fuck on. I wont complain about getting a free asset since he wasnt gonna play for us anyways but hes handled this like a bitch. I agree, no jersey retirement for him
fo47j41	1587499534	Jets	nfl	here for it, he wont be in New England he cant hurt me anymore
fo47jjs	1587499540	Seahawks	team	 You cant break all that down into a couple of charts and say see running the ball doesnt impact the outcome of your offense. What I can trust is the countless people who actually play the game saying yes running the ball is helpful toward opening up our gameplanBasically you dont trust empirical data, but rather the words of an authority figure.
fo47jbr	1587499537	Lions	team	 I wouldnt hate Trevor honestly. I think if Patricia washes out here this year then we should really think about blowing it up. Keep the young guys like Kenny G and such, but getting Staffords contract off the books (If possible) would allow for freedom for developingaquiring other players on rookie deals. It seems to be the way the league is moving now. Your window consists of whenever you get hold of the rookie contract QB and lasts until you decide to pay him. Unless your guy is Brady I guess.
fo47jpd	1587499542	Bears	team	Different eras.McMahon had crazy talent and had the attitude. Injuries derailed his career.Not to mention hed constantly audible because he actually understood NFL defenses.
fo47jwf	1587499545	Patriots	nfl	will be disappointed if tom throws less than 45tds.
fo47jww	1587499545	Patriots	team	Good, do it. If he wants to come back after this whole ordeal, he said he was broken, football was ruining his life, I loved the guy and sympathized with him. I mean how can you fault that if thats really how he dealt. However, something about him has not felt right since retirement, its felt like a cash grab or trying to pump up his own brand and I get it if it benefits your own personal interests and future. His endeavors obviously havent panned out post his playing career and he wasnt having fun in New England. Loved the guy playing here but he has become a contradictive nuisance since. Get what you can now and lets move on.
fo47k3f	1587499548	Colts	team	The end was 16 counts of improv so...I felt going rogue was appropriate.
fo47jln	1587499541	Jaguars	team	Relevant
fo47jms	1587499541	Vikings	team	interplanetaryPlutoBro, Ive got some bad news for you...
fo47joa	1587499542	Bengals	team	I have been saying the same thing about Memphis uniforms. I would kill for a gray uniform
fo47js2	1587499543	Texans	team	There werent financial guarantees in those final 3 years. People forget that. He had every right to ask for a new deal.
fo47jvo	1587499544	Buccaneers	team	The NFL really makes me want to kill myself sometimes.
fo47jwj	1587499545	Patriots	nfl	Any MNF game better be off the table for him. Need him to defend his title on Monday Night Raw each week.
fo47k6x	1587499549	Patriots	nfl	247 champion rob gronkowski
fo47k8e	1587499550	Seahawks	nfl	The point was to illustrate the fact that 99 of his completions will be dump offs.
fo47ki0	1587499553	Ravens	team	Lamars got such a kind face, man. I always catch myself smiling when he does
fo47kra	1587499556	Steelers	nfl	If he does, I dont see him playing a full season. Remember Jerry Rices awkward decline?
fo47kj2	1587499553	Packers	team	Not a fan of his personality but he is a good writer.
fo47kkc	1587499554	Buccaneers	nfl	YHIS SEASON BETTER NOT GET FUCKING CANCELED
fo47ksl	1587499557	Packers	team	TE. I wouldnt be mad at all if we moved up and snagged Jordan Love. In fact that might be our best option
fo47kv8	1587499558	Lions	team	I dont get it. I said attempting to get experts. Youre reading a lot into a little friend.
fo47kxf	1587499559	Giants	nfl	 They dont have to accept him onto their roster if he unretires though iirc.And then hes free to sign with the Bucs with no draft compensation
fo47khl	1587499553	Redskins	team	The offense is clearly in need of upgrades, but with a very deep WR class, Id think we could get an upgrade at that position at 66. This is a shittier TE class, on the other hand, so I wouldnt count on finding anything in the draft there.Also, we dont need to (and probably wont) fix everything in one draft, especially one where we dont have a second round pick. Be patient. This is not going to be an overnight rebuild. Were not competing for shit this year. Just take BPA and then see what happens next offseason when we have a shitton of cap space to play with and in all likelihood yet another top5 pick. Unless its a QB, you just dont draft for need and find success in this league. We could have Derwin James on this roster right now if wed gone BPA.
fo47ku3	1587499557	Patriots	team	What? You arent a fan of him playing off of the emotion of our fan base for a joke that wasnt funny the first time?
fo47kwb	1587499558	Saints	nfl	When this pandemic is over and if smaller towns is your thing, check out downtown Frederick. Its about 2540 mins from moco, depending on which part of the city. Theyve got some great breweries, local restaurants and minor league baseball.
fo47l0c	1587499560	Titans	team	Im hard
fo47l23	1587499560	Patriots	team	Head says this is great, weve got a ton of leverage here. Heart says god dammit, I dont want to lose two of the GOATs to another team in a single offseason
fo47l5i	1587499562	Colts	team	So wed lose value in two places, by likely moving back in the draft from the second pick of the round, and also by pushing a pick down the road which has inherent negative value as well? No thank you.
fo47l94	1587499563	Patriots	team	Randy Mosss son is in this draft
fo47lao	1587499564	Jets	nfl	You offending the Peoples Tight End George Kittle sir!
fo47kpz	1587499556	Patriots	nfl	Honestly I want to trade Edelman too. Literally stack the Bucs and rebuild at the same time. Its a win win. We get our rebuild and Tom gets to rape the league with Mike Evans, Julian Edelman, Rob Gronkowski, and Chris Godwin.
fo47krz	1587499557	Patriots	team	I mean... what do you think they would offer for him?
fo47ks1	1587499557	Buccaneers	nfl	The memes will be legendary
fo47kxx	1587499559	Buccaneers	nfl	In what world is a retired player who only wants to play for Tampa worth more than OJ.
fo47l0q	1587499560	Patriots	nfl	Not fair.
fo47l61	1587499562	Jaguars	nfl	I imagine it could be helpful to have a comprehensive updating big board that doesnt require any scrolling or switching tabs. One large monitor like that could probably display a TON of players to keep track of.
fo47l9v	1587499563	Browns	team	Nope.  Im not interested even if we didnt have to give up a draft pick.  Linemen rarely last longer than age 32 and thats especially true for someone who is injury prone.  We should draft a long term solution at LT and spend that cap money on something else like defense.  Its frankly ridiculous we are even considering it (and it may be a smokescreen).  We are paying top dollar to our guard (6 highest paid), center (6) , and right tackle (3) right now.  Add in a 15 million left tackle and we will find ourselves in cap hell in two years.  Not to mention, it makes little sense to go allin with a vet when we arent completely sure theres going to be a season this fall.
fo47lci	1587499564	Patriots	team	Fuck that, its a well rested Gronk give us everything
fo47le5	1587499565	Jaguars	team	Holy shit it only got better and better. Love that movie
fo47li0	1587499566	Rams	team	Agreed. Pisses me off every time I see it. If they screw up the unis, I could really see the chargers take a bite of the market share. People like cool branding
fo47kyb	1587499559	Patriots	nfl	not mad lol. If we can get any return on someone who is retired Im happy.
fo47kzu	1587499559	Titans	nfl	Are sprained ankles worse than AIDS? Im just curious, because there are way more sprained ankles each year than new AIDS cases.
fo47l1q	1587499560	Seahawks	team	Im genuinely asking this question because I dont follow college football or the draft particularly closely (I know, I know), but is there even a chance that a SPARQ god like Gibson falls to the late rounds? Even Ive heard an incredible amount of buzz around this guy. Ive watched his highlight reel and I WANT this guy to be a Seahawk, but I dont know how realistic it is.
fo47l2p	1587499561	Panthers	nfl	Its a cycle
fo47l54	1587499561	49ers	nfl	Dont be a Cowherd. Put speedhawk up there.
fo47lfo	1587499565	Patriots	team	No thanks. Draft picks please.
fo47ljv	1587499567	Buccaneers	team	It doesnt make sense to have Gronk, Brate and Howard all on the roster. 1 of brate or howard would have to get traded, right?
fo47lku	1587499567	Patriots	team	I completely agree. It doesnt help that all last season he alluded to coming out of retirement when he had no intention of doing so. Its whatever. Im just happy we can get something for him because he has no intention of playing for the patriots.
fo47ltp	1587499570	Giants	nfl	Arians Strikes Back Episode V

fo47lnc	1587499568	49ers	nfl	Delpit has a very high ceiling I think late teens to twenties is good value
fo47lxp	1587499572	Buccaneers	nfl	(unzips)keep going.
fo47ly6	1587499572	Packers	nfl	Im leaving it P doesnt bother me. I dont think its that radical of a decision with the crazy offseason we are having. Best of luck to Burrow and the Bengals.

fo47liz	1587499566	Buccaneers	team	Ill eat one in your honor
fo47lu6	1587499571	Browns	nfl	One winning season, his rookie year...
fo47lw4	1587499571	Patriots	nfl	yeah fuck it hes not suiting up for the Pats again. If you can even get a 5th for him thats a win IMO
fo47lz4	1587499573	Patriots	team	Compensation better start with the 45th pick or I hang up
fo47m4n	1587499575	Patriots	team	Isnt it tricky for the pats to get a good haul for gronk? Hes due like 10ish mil and the pats definitely dont have that so it seems like gronk has a good amount of leverage right?
fo47mcd	1587499578	Buccaneers	nfl	Stop I can only get so erect
fo47m59	1587499575	Patriots	team	Chill... We can get more for Thuney in my opinion. If they cant get deal done with Thuney hes def worth a first honestly.
fo47m5l	1587499575	Patriots	team	OH COME ON
fo47mav	1587499577	Patriots	nfl	Nope a first pls and mike Evans and Howard.
fo47mf6	1587499579	Buccaneers	nfl	We really are doing whatever TB wants us to do.
fo47mgl	1587499580	Dolphins	team	That would actually be the most Dolphins thing ever. Trading up to 3, but not for Tua, for an offensive lineman. LMAO
fo47mmt	1587499582	Jaguars	team	Trade back to 1416 and acquire more picks, take best available
fo47mpl	1587499583	Bears	team	If Jordan love is still in round two. Ya the bears need to consider . Trade Mitch for peanuts. And trade your second to accumulate more picks.
fo47mry	1587499584	Redskins	team	I cant see the Patriots allowing themselves to be strongarmed like this.  Or giving Brady anything else to help him be successful there.But if Im the Patriots, I make this trade in a heartbeat.  The guy has been out of football and he was a walking infirmary at times.  I dont wait for anyone to see if the guy doesnt have a lot of juice left (hes almost 31).  Im trading him for as much as I can.  Let Tom have his toy, the two teams are in different conferences anyway.
fo47mbd	1587499578	Redskins	team	Or we could just take the player with a cheap rookie contract and stay at 2? This is literally the dumbest trade Ive seen.
fo47mbf	1587499578	Patriots	team	Fuck Id do it.
fo47mfo	1587499579	Jets	nfl	Gronk is way better player, but considering all it took was a 5th rounder for a 6th to get Lynch from the Seahawks in a similar situation, that seems like a massive overpay
fo47mgt	1587499580	Falcons	nfl	Yall just need a kicker...Blankenship at 2nd?
fo47mh2	1587499580	Patriots	team	Teams trade players against their will all the time. Why is it only a betrayal when a player requests a trade?
fo47miq	1587499580	Patriots	team	Oh boy, I cant wait to see all the Gronk lovers quickly turn on him and say fuck Gronk just like they do every time a Patriot player leaves for another team. Its pathetic.
fo47mr0	1587499583	Dolphins	team	Id rather have Love or Herbert over Tua but regardless we better not be trading up for anyone unless its a QB.  Have we forgotten what happened last time we took a tackle (Jake Long) instead of a QB (Matt Ryan).    And we certainly dont need to trade up for Love at .  He will probably still be there in the teens.
fo47mrn	1587499584	Patriots	nfl	Brady with Gronk, Howard, Godwin, and Evans? Lord....... Gronkour lowest 3rd rounder for a 2nd. Do it. Do it now.
fo47msj	1587499584	Falcons	nfl	Damn you Bruce Arians and your good footballing coaching skills and your recruitment tactics and your nice city by the beach and your Pirate Ship in the stadium and your.....and your....
fo47mum	1587499585	Chargers	nfl	The hip injury was not something that would happen to any QB. The hit was not an out of the ordinary hit, one you see multiple times a week.That said, the hip injury wouldnt scare me off from drafting Tua. Hes had a crazy amount of success and is brimming with talent. Sadly hes a lefty, which throws off an offense, but a good OC will adjust to that. Tua is worth the top 5 pick for sure.
fo47n3w	1587499588	Browns	nfl	Yeah just because the account is meant to be funny doesnt mean it never has legit news. Hell we allow clowns on here who say they have national breaking news and then tell us one player tested positive for the virus. If Leroy isnt allowed then Jay Glazer shouldnt be allowed
fo47mtt	1587499585	Patriots	nfl	That was my first inkling as well. My brain immediately went to 4th is probably the upper parameter and more likely a 5th or 6th
fo47n9u	1587499590	Colts	nfl	Hes just going to go away and throw away his promising WWE career like that?!
fo47nbo	1587499591	Packers	nfl	This really reminded me how good of targets Romo had coming in. Cant ask for much better than TO and Witten.
fo47nch	1587499591	Raiders	nfl	Are you trying to insinuate that Jameis Pick Sex Winston is a bust?
fo47ne1	1587499592	Patriots	nfl	Buccaneers gonna land Tom Brady and Gronkowski, then 2020 season is gonna get cancelled
fo47mrc	1587499583	Cardinals	team	When we have a QB on a rookie contract, yes
fo47my1	1587499586	Lions	team	Probably since 2009
fo47n3k	1587499588	Bengals	nfl	Games 28 were not competitive in any meaningful way. At all.
fo47ndf	1587499592	Packers	team	For The Record? That was a really good book.
fo47nbd	1587499591	Buccaneers	nfl	Nut
fo47ndx	1587499592	Titans	team	Ive been looking everywhere for a Nike Kern jersey but cant find one
fo47ngt	1587499593	Eagles	nfl	 hope 247 Champ Gronk defends his title during a game
fo47nej	1587499592	Lions	team	It sounds like you are projecting. You shouldnt support someone if you think they are bad at their job lol
fo47nh6	1587499593	Buccaneers	team	This rumor is enough to buy a custom one tbh
fo47niw	1587499594	Giants	team	 he did look good against good teams in the best conference in collegejust good, really?  thats how youre going to describe his performances against the best teams in the country good
fo47nwx	1587499599	Patriots	nfl	Lmao I would love that, but no fucking way we get all that
fo47o1b	1587499601	Patriots	nfl	I feel like so much crazy stuff happened we forgot he pretty much said Allow CBD in the NFL and Ill come back. People probably thought he was just saying that to promote his CBD products.
fo47o5q	1587499603	Patriots	team	I hate this timeline.
fo47nm2	1587499595	Redskins	team	1sr of all praying for a draft is stupid. 2nd the draft is Thursday. This might go down as one of the worst post Ive ever seen.
fo47nrd	1587499597	Buccaneers	team	Lmao. I love this video of them.
fo47o5x	1587499603	Buccaneers	team	Pats fans  (
fo47o6i	1587499603	Titans	nfl	Yard fully mowed AND trimmed. Hadnt run the trimmer in almost a year, but it started up pretty easily. Considering its at least 15 years old (on permanent loan from my dad), Im impressed. They just dont make em like they used to.
fo47oa2	1587499604	Bears	team	If he didnt get hurt in back to back years I wouldnt mind picking it up, but the risk isnt worth it imo considering we can address QB via the draft and FA in 2021 if they havent got someone this season. We should have a full draft, and while that might change I dont see us trading our first, Mitch and Foles can be cut as well. That said I would like to add a late roundudfa QB as a backup to the QB problem in 2021, basically just as a cheap young person who would have some experience to add for competition.
fo47of8	1587499606	49ers	team	The Baba Yaga
fo47oig	1587499608	Cardinals	team	Its not a bad idea to have extra RBs for depth. Both the Cardinals and Seahawks roster lost all there RBs at one point.
fo47o7o	1587499603	Patriots	nfl	Gronk coming back would destroy our salary cap.
fo47oc6	1587499605	Jets	nfl	Dont worry, you can be at the bottom of the division with us. (
fo47oe3	1587499606	Vikings	nfl	Sauce?
fo47ogs	1587499607	Patriots	team	So is Gronk gonna drop the 247 championship? I think itd be more interesting if he has to defend it even during football games lol.
fo47osc	1587499611	Patriots	team	Gronk for Mayo and a first who says no
fo47omi	1587499609	Titans	team	Cool
fo47opv	1587499611	Buccaneers	nfl	That would be ridiculously overpaying for a guy whos going to play one or two years at most and has said he wants to play but only for another team.
fo47ojf	1587499608	Titans	nfl	This is gonna end with Tom brady being 247 champion isnt jt
fo47otu	1587499612	Chargers	team	I bought a Kobe jersey like right after he passed and it said July originally but moved up to June so September is just the date itll ship at latest.
fo47p37	1587499615	Patriots	team	More.
fo47p6u	1587499617	Chargers	team	Marlon McRee would have just FALLEN DOWN.
fo47pdp	1587499619	Ravens	team	Holy shit, ty, love the artwork
fo47p3n	1587499616	Patriots	team	Howarda 2nd (maybe 3rd) for Gronk.
fo47p3t	1587499616	Giants	nfl	 Bucs should trade Brady to the Patriots for him, they need a QB
fo47pal	1587499618	Browns	nfl	Pretty good one, from what I heard he spent his whole career running for his life.
fo47pcw	1587499619	Eagles	nfl	It wasnt just because of the botched snap. He had a career with high profile turnovers in big nationally televised moments on a talented team that consistently won games on a road to nowhere.
fo47pi2	1587499621	Giants	nfl	247 champion
fo47pcv	1587499619	Raiders	team	You see, Simmons can effectively play every position on the defense in a Nickel set other then the DTackle positions. Imagine a defense that never has to substitute from 1st to 3rd down. Also, hes going to eliminate TEs. The best TEs in the NFL reside in our division.
fo47pj5	1587499622	Falcons	nfl	What is Gronk gunna do otherwise? Hes under contract. He has no leverage really.
fo47pjz	1587499622	49ers	nfl	If there was no rules about weed and nfl JG would have been one of the top receivers in the past decade..all while smoking weed everyday
fo47pmj	1587499623	Patriots	nfl	This one hurts. Like deep inside. Howard or Brate and a third or second for Gronk will make it hurt less. If we just give Gronk away for a 5th because we cant handle his cap hit then Im going to cry.
fo47ppa	1587499624	Jets	nfl	Patrick Mahomes is too
fo47pb7	1587499619	Cowboys	nfl	People seem to forget that Big Ben was absolutely atrocious his first few years in the league, he was carried by some monster defenses.
fo47pn4	1587499623	Lions	team	Lmao, this years draft is like watching a lions game live. I have both emotions of being excitement and also terrified. I have hopes we come out of this with a win but also a lingering feeling we get screwed somehow. Im scared guys, im just scared lol.
fo47pyk	1587499628	Ravens	team	Hopefully if there is a madden curse it is COVID19 cancels ball. Cant have anything happen to Llama
fo47pkf	1587499622	49ers	nfl	FIESTA HAS RETURNED
fo47q8o	1587499632	Chargers	team	Yes he finesses them routes
fo47qfk	1587499635	Bears	team	Josh Gordon likes this
fo47q1l	1587499629	Bears	team	I mean a top corner on a great defense  of course he is high on our draft boards.  Gotta be realistic though, we need our picks...
fo47q3q	1587499630	Patriots	team	I get the feeling Justin Jefferson is going to be the best receiver in this draft. Id be ecstatic if we drafted him, but hes apparently shooting up draft boards.
fo47q4z	1587499630	Broncos	team	Bad breakups like this are a sign that players dont like to leave.Im going to ignore this and welcome CHJ back when we put him in the Ring of Fame.
fo47q7s	1587499631	Bears	team	I have no idea lol.
fo47q82	1587499632	Broncos	team	We also lost will parks. Its not a huge need, but I would expect to see a safety drafted in the mid to late rounds
fo47q9g	1587499632	Browns	nfl	Werent the Lions competitive with Sanders?
fo47qvw	1587499641	Patriots	team	It is not. Gronk gets traded before his cap hit ever touches NEs cap. His 10 million was removed due to his retirement.
fo47qto	1587499640	Bears	nfl	Or bill could not do the deal, gronk remains retired, and he gets nothing. Bill had literally zero leverage
fo47qvf	1587499641	Browns	nfl	If he unretires, do we start a new lineage belt based based on who tackles Gronk?
fo47r3l	1587499644	Bengals	team	Reread my question
fo47qqq	1587499639	Titans	nfl	I remember spraining an ankle in college. It was the worst. I died.
fo47qsd	1587499640	Patriots	team	Ya I would much rather get a safe trade in OJ
fo47qvm	1587499641	Steelers	nfl	As far as that O.J. goes, people really give him too much crap for that heistrobbery thing
fo47qxr	1587499641	Patriots	team	So like they owed him the years on his contract to be a patriot when they agreed to send him to Detroit.  He didnt sign a contract to play for Detroit, stop defending billionaire executives.
fo47qyb	1587499642	Buccaneers	team	Interested
fo47r07	1587499642	Chargers	nfl	Usually Im told we only have 7 fans? We are up to 766 now? Damn, the new uniforms are working already 
fo47r78	1587499645	Saints	team	Yawn, he could barely stay on the field the last few years with the patriots. Hes washed
fo47qsh	1587499640	Bills	nfl	Im pretty sure they can keep him on the reserves or retired list or he would have to pass a physical.And again hes most likely not filing for reinstatement until his rights are traded. Or else he wouldve done it already.
fo47r32	1587499643	Packers	nfl	5010
fo47r66	1587499645	Jaguars	team	Not going rb at 20, I think we learned our lesson with first round running backs
fo47qu7	1587499640	Dolphins	nfl	Nope he was injured that season, Matt Moore played when you guys shut us out
fo47r47	1587499644	Patriots	team	Just when I thought this year couldnt get any worse... Im hurt.
fo47r7c	1587499645	Eagles	team	The most dominant sports dynasty of our lifetime ran an offense through Gronk at TE and Edelman in the slot though...
fo47rjq	1587499650	49ers	nfl	What a nasty comment
fo47rkg	1587499650	Dolphins	nfl	This is far more funny when its not in your division.
fo47r2i	1587499643	Texans	nfl	But hell be back anyway.
fo47r7x	1587499645	Falcons	team	ParkGate has begun.
fo47rtt	1587499653	Broncos	team	See my comment below
fo47rwy	1587499654	Steelers	team	I support the Chinn pick. We have no safety depth and in the modern sub package nfl, Chinn will be on the field in Mark Barons role from last year. I personally would have preferred Austin Jackson as hes a franchise LT in the making but I get the logic Love Harrison Bryant...does this mean Vance is cuttraded?AGG is going to be a studLove Darrington Evans, I have him as my legit Diamond in the rough at RBDont know enough about Bradly for an opinion but we need depth with Red gone and Gilbert unprovenLike me some Bravvion, want him in the 7th if we dont take Fotu or Davon Harrison in the mid rounds All in all I like it
fo47rd0	1587499647	Patriots	team	And their QBs first son!
fo47re4	1587499647	Falcons	nfl	Gronk definitely hasnt stayed in playing shape like Lynch either
fo47ris	1587499649	Buccaneers	nfl	FUCK ME
fo47rnp	1587499651	Patriots	nfl	This one feels weirder than Brady for some reasonI dont like it.
fo47rt8	1587499653	Patriots	team	Honestly, I think theres a chance we never see football this year. He may be doing this for publicity because he knows that too.
fo47rtl	1587499653	Patriots	team	Fly free big man.
fo47rms	1587499651	Rams	team	Couldnt agree more with your addendum. I would add that they seem to be more interested in LA more than the Rams.
fo47roe	1587499651	Patriots	team	To be fair it sounds fucking stupid
fo47s2c	1587499656	Patriots	team	Sad yes, but as a football fan Im actually excited to see him back in football. Such a fun player in the league.
fo47s3c	1587499657	Patriots	team	Listen I have no problem with this as long as we get more picks for the draft lol.
fo47s70	1587499658	Redskins	team	Gotta give everyone a day notice. Also who took a piss in your Cheerios?
fo47sb6	1587499660	Falcons	team	Team 1
fo47rxl	1587499655	Eagles	team	We would never boo him
fo47s2z	1587499657	49ers	nfl	Id hardly call Jameis a bust. He hasnt lived up to expectations but hes by no means a bust.
fo47sdt	1587499661	Bears	team	Any chance we make an offer for Hooker?
fo47ski	1587499664	Giants	nfl	That preference only existed in RZ packages.
fo47rw6	1587499654	Lions	team	If they pass on Okudah Id take a Logan Ryan
fo47rz7	1587499655	Vikings	team	I disagree with everything you just said lol. We literally did all of those things to mitigate our weakness at G, and we had a bottom 5 offensive line. You can only hide so much. You named two of the most important positions in WR and CB. G isnt the sexiest,or the most important position on the field, but if your G group is one of the worst in the league, it will ruin games for you, and it did for us. Multiple times. For every team like Oakland, there is a team like Philly, who also invested heavily in their offensive line, and it turned out well. Almost like there are other important positions on the offense that matter. As for Ruiz, saying that he would be the worst 1st round pick since Treadwell doesnt mean much, seeing as the only 1st round picks we have had since then have been Hughes and Bradbury. He will go in the 1st, and it will be a good pickup for whatever team gets him. He is a versatile, strong IOL who can move well. He will have a good shot to become a long term starter in this league imo.
fo47sb1	1587499660	Eagles	team	Except not lots of cheers, but explosive standing ovation when he enters the game.  Like a gameinterrupting standing ovation.  And that should be literally forevereven if he were to play for the Giants, Cowboys, or Skins.Oh, and hell never pay for another meal in this town as long as he lives.
fo47sey	1587499661	Jaguars	nfl	Im taking him first overall in my fantasy draft
fo47sfq	1587499662	Dolphins	nfl	There it is.
fo47sj6	1587499663	Colts	team	Future picks are always less valuable than current picks anyway, so no matter what were losing a ton of value in that trade.
fo47spn	1587499666	Patriots	nfl	Now I see where this is going. Gronk will score a TD, then outta nowhere somebody will take his ass down with a clothesline and pin him.
fo47sbx	1587499660	Patriots	nfl	Damn cant believe hes that old already. Used to love me some Caddy
fo47t1n	1587499670	Jaguars	team	Ill second that.
fo47sta	1587499667	Panthers	nfl	Yes, while discussing what happened during the game.
fo47stv	1587499667	49ers	nfl	Get tf out of the NFC
fo47t30	1587499671	Cowboys	team	 Because the Cowboys last championship was in 1995, a lot of people think all of this attention is unwarrantedKind of is at this point. Havent done shit in a quarter century
fo47t3a	1587499671	Titans	team	Frick yes
fo47tao	1587499673	Cowboys	team	New England is going to get OJ for the rights to Gronk
fo47tht	1587499676	Falcons	nfl	Exactly. So doesnt hurt the Pats any.
fo47tak	1587499673	Rams	nfl	GRONK TO BUCS FOR A 4TH
fo47tfy	1587499675	Buccaneers	team	So trade oj for gronk. Pats need to clear cap space anyway and oj is cheap
fo47thc	1587499676	Vikings	team	Tbf, Wirfs is less of a mechanics issue and more of a combination of footwork technique he was taught and lack of confidence in his footwork IMO.
fo47tmq	1587499678	Patriots	team	2nd and 4th if we cant get a 3rd.
fo47toy	1587499679	Colts	nfl	I mean at least hes not playing for the Pats. But dammit, I hope its not true. I cannot stand Gronks stupid face.
fo47tq4	1587499679	Giants	team	I emphasized the word good because I figured anybody that watched him would realize that he fucking tore it up.
fo47tcx	1587499674	Lions	team	TLDR
fo47tkd	1587499677	Bears	nfl	In all seriousness, how does this makes any sense for the Bucs? They have a younger, very likely healthier and football ready OJ Howard (who doesnt seem to me getting very good return value in trade talks considering hes still on their team). Gronk couldnt stay healthy at all towards the end of his career and now hes not in football shape. Gronk was great, but this isnt 2015 anymore. Plus, theres no way Bill is just gonna hand his rights to Tampa for nothing and help Tom out, so the Bucs are probably going to have to take on his remaining cap hit and give up additional value. From a football perspective I dont understand it
fo47toi	1587499679	Falcons	team	People have their livelihoods damaged because the government has failed them. What happened to Trumps best economy? Turns out that was same imprudent deficit spending driven bullshit that we saw ten years ago under the same party that incessantly talks about fiscal responsibility but never practices it. If the economy was as strong as yall dummies claimed, and if yall dummies knew how to manage an economy and nation, we should have had more than enough resources prepared to handle this crisis. Kemp and his party have handled this poorly every single fucking chance theyve had and now you want to risk making this situation worse because the Republicans have been nonstop shitting the bed for almost an entire century and you dont want any of the blame or clean up any of the mess yourselves. You are dumb fucking children running around making messes spreading diseases and shit yall fucking nasty.
fo47tzd	1587499683	Dolphins	nfl	Im so glad I can see this headline and not have to worry anymore. Go fucking nuts Bucs. This should be entertaining
fo47tkn	1587499677	Giants	nfl	Yes please.
fo47tog	1587499679	Patriots	team	Right. Que the the pats really owe him crowd who were prob also saying he should never play football again because it will do long term damage. The pats really have all the leverage for a 1st rounder or nothing but may take a 2nd  or 3rd over nothing
fo47tzr	1587499683	Browns	team	Ordered on the 17th from the pro shop. My order is still pending. Live 40 minuets away.......
fo47u5s	1587499685	Dolphins	team	18 and 26 isnt near enough to move to 3.   That would take 18, 26, a 1st next year, and probably a few 2nds somewhere.  It took the Redskins 3  1s and a 2nd to go from 6 to 2 and that isnt near the jump your talking.
fo47trg	1587499680	Jets	team	Im not an OL coach but from what Ive read his technique could use some work. Im not saying hes a bust but that may be why people have him a little bit lower.
fo47u02	1587499683	Panthers	nfl	So not much different than Cam with the broken body he currently inhabits
fo47u1j	1587499683	Giants	nfl	I see your point about the trade not happening without Detroit being involved, but I still think its wishful thinking to assume that Detroit would want to do this, when they dont really have a reason to.
fo47u4x	1587499685	Ravens	team	all 3 of our starters are over 30 with a 1 year contract, and 2 2 year contracts. Grabbing an elite d lineman to sub in for a year before becoming a starter isnt a bad idea even if its not exactly a huge position of need right now. Especially if that lineman is a good pass rusher, who can be subbed in passing downs for Brandon Williams, who is much more of a run defender
fo47ubl	1587499687	Patriots	team	Yeah, either stay retired or give us the farm. Idgaf how greedy that sounds. Pats have the leverage.
fo47ued	1587499688	Cardinals	nfl	This comment had a dynamicness to it that made me feel alive for the first time in months
fo47uhs	1587499689	Saints	nfl	didnt he just sign a contract with the WWE?
fo47u4e	1587499684	Buccaneers	team	As if this whole situation could get any more insane. What alternative reality is this?!?!
fo47uea	1587499688	Cowboys	nfl	I have my own more biased take on Romo against other Dallas QBs but hes undoubtedly top 3 cowboys qb ever. There is no legitimate argument for anyone over him besides Staubach and Aikman
fo47umx	1587499691	Bears	team	a lot of chatter going on saying that hell be taken a lot earlier than expected. I wouldnt be surprised if someone grabs him in the 1st.
fo47upk	1587499692	Rams	team	I tried that and it ended up looking like a separate horn.
fo47uwg	1587499695	Chargers	nfl	Its the same helmet. Just different decals and face mask. The helmet shell, is the part that cant be switched.
fo47v9k	1587499700	49ers	team	It appears the Niners have traded both their first rounders for half of the fifth round
fo47ved	1587499702	Patriots	team	Wasnt funny the 10th or 23rd time either
fo47v2j	1587499697	Dolphins	nfl	Ooh, OJ Howard going somewhere 
fo47v4d	1587499698	Buccaneers	team	Doubt it lol. Gronk wont ever come back and play for us again now that Brady is gone
fo47v6l	1587499699	Patriots	team	Thats coming next
fo47va8	1587499700	Patriots	team	Your probably right. I well be disappointed in the return.
fo47va7	1587499700	Steelers	nfl	Brian flores Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design
fo47vbj	1587499700	Steelers	nfl	The Ty Law rule was made just before 2004, so 2004 was the true start of the passhappy league.
fo47v6b	1587499699	Dolphins	team	What hes trying to say is A. The way he tried to say it, F.
fo47v7z	1587499699	Browns	nfl	Destroyed Lucks body and spirit.
fo47vqb	1587499706	Giants	nfl	Calling him a catalyst for winning the super bowl and basing it on one game is a rather poor way to justify Chase Young
fo47vsd	1587499707	Browns	team	Thats good to know. I had seen some comments on release day that it was just the team shop, which swayed me somewhat, but once I found out they were shipping right away and not over the summer, that was enough to convince me.
fo47vdv	1587499701	Texans	nfl	Stay retired..
fo47vkm	1587499704	Browns	team	 just sign a blocking TE off the streetRight, yeah its totally just that simple
fo47vq4	1587499706	Patriots	nfl	gostkowski got released
fo47vpi	1587499706	Patriots	nfl	Why do we care? Gronk is a legend. And will always be a patriot. Id love to see him tear it up again, even if its in a Buc uniform.
fo47vw2	1587499708	Patriots	team	Yeah, I wont lie, Im feeling pretty down about it too
fo47vyv	1587499709	Redskins	team	Yeah just go ahead and delete this thread bud
fo47w3q	1587499711	Giants	nfl	Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be.
fo47w9n	1587499713	Cowboys	nfl	Dont forget that that punt they elected to take after the delay of game traveled a distance of 9 yards because it was horribly shanked as well
fo47wjq	1587499717	Patriots	team	Their leverage is they dont have to agree to a trade.
fo47wtw	1587499721	Browns	team	I live in nw Ohio, hoping to have mine for the draft! Ordered at noon Tuesday. Cleveland to me is typically one day from all 3 big shippers (I order truck parts daily lol)
fo47wev	1587499715	Redskins	team	Im fine, but this thread is stupid. All the shit going on in the world right now and you suggest praying for draft picks. Come on
fo47wyy	1587499723	Giants	nfl	Danny white
fo47wh0	1587499716	Jaguars	nfl	And Tampa hosts the Super Bowl this season too
fo47wtj	1587499721	Seahawks	nfl	Honestly depends. Gronk is not in football shape and the draft is essentially now. Trading a 2nd round pick for a player you have no idea will be able to make your team is a pretty dumb idea, even if it is for Gronk. I think trading JUST OJ Howard should suffice. Bill gets a stud TE with massive upside and gets Gronk off the books, because if Gronk were to unretire, theyd have to do something about his cap hit regardless.
fo47x6p	1587499726	Lions	nfl	yo soy fiesta
fo47wus	1587499721	49ers	nfl	Those are fantastic!
fo47wy8	1587499722	Dolphins	nfl	AhemFuck Nick Saban
fo47wzb	1587499723	Cowboys	nfl	4020
fo47wu2	1587499721	Patriots	team	Lol I have no clue, but it wont be much since he will be 34 and they already have an arsenal of WRs.
fo47wvq	1587499722	Vikings	nfl	I mean thats on one season. If we look at both seasons Bosa was fully healthy and hunters two seasons starting Bosa has 11 TFL and 18, compared to Hunters 21 and 15.
fo47wz0	1587499723	Browns	nfl	Ohhhh i didnt know that
fo47xc6	1587499727	Saints	nfl	I have a phone screen in less than an hour, Ive been a bit productive today (dicking around on my computer) and Im ready for a nap.
fo47xc8	1587499727	Vikings	nfl	Oh shit Gronk might return
fo47x7y	1587499726	Saints	team	In 2019 we got destroyed by TEs in important games. (Kittle and Rudolph)
fo47xmk	1587499732	Packers	nfl	I still think Brady is gonna crater down to earth this season. Father Time is undefeated.
fo47xqs	1587499733	Seahawks	nfl	Wait till AB joins too.
fo47xvg	1587499735	Chiefs	nfl	Not only is it money laundering, but its such a well known method that there are regulations in place to deter it because it was and still is so prominent.
fo47y99	1587499740	Redskins	team	Why not just take tua and have both haskins and tua?Theres really no benefit to having both. If Tua beats Haskins for the starting job, it probably decreases Haskins value and doesnt give a chance to showcase his skills for a trade. If Haskins beats Tua, then his value would go up but then you really question choosing Tua in the first place. Just do what the cardinals did and dont create controversy, tell your top pick pick hes the guy and trade the other QB on draft day.
fo47ygn	1587499743	Buccaneers	team	Lets be real. How TF is this gonna happen when hes holding a WWE title?! He gonna play Sunday morning then hit up Survivor Series at night? GTFO lol.
fo47xsq	1587499734	Patriots	nfl	Sign Gostkowski too, then all of your dreams will cum true.
fo47xwt	1587499735	Eagles	team	Hes from Daingerfield, Texas. Its nowherrrrreeeeee east Texas. And then hes spent what, four years (I think hes a senior) in Waco, which is the size of like, Allentown.I know plenty of country folk that might not have had a good time in Philly its a different world. And I think thats probably the case with Mims too, and its ridiculous to read anymore into it.He even said he thinks hed like it if he came again.
fo47y1m	1587499737	49ers	team	BIG HIT MITCH Hes a huge improvement over Pinion, thats for sure.
fo47y3x	1587499738	Saints	team	Agree, Im not worried about Gronk at all.
fo47y9e	1587499740	Patriots	nfl	Hell be with Brady. It wouldnt be completely new.
fo47xyb	1587499736	Falcons	team	Def the gradient.Im buying a Gradient Gurley myself, and a Black Ryan.The Julio numbers dont show the pointy nature of the new font so Ill pass.
fo47ya8	1587499740	Bengals	nfl	We like to talk about how that 124 season ended though
fo47yk8	1587499744	Patriots	team	Stop (
fo47ya7	1587499740	Cowboys	nfl	Nah lmao
fo47yfx	1587499742	Bears	nfl	Barry Sanders
fo47ygt	1587499743	49ers	nfl	via rap(httpstwitter.comRapSheetstatus1252684831357632518?s20)
fo47yez	1587499742	Bears	team	Are we living in a parallel universe where Alshon didnt turn down more money from Pace and go out of his way to play for the Eagles? And where Gould didnt just have his worse season in his career and who himself said that getting cut was what he needed to remotivate himself to go above and beyond?
fo47yvi	1587499748	Lions	nfl	Exactly. Like the other guy said anything they get is found money for a player who is retired. The pats arent gonna say no to any kind of compensation unless they plain dont want Gronk to play for any other team.
fo47z06	1587499750	Titans	nfl	This news should have been released yesterday
fo47ymr	1587499745	Eagles	team	What simulator do you use?
fo47ymy	1587499745	Patriots	team	Why is everyone upset. I mean we are literally going to trade someone that is retired and his best years are behind him. Possible for someone people on this sub have been wanting since last season. Its a win  win.
fo47yoq	1587499746	Broncos	nfl	Firmly against Gronk playing again. I actually dont give a fuck about the bucs landing him, I just was so hyped for Gronk Beach Tampa Bay
fo47ywp	1587499749	Patriots	team	Id do it for a 2nd and trade up with our 1st and a 3rd, but time will tell.
fo47z8e	1587499753	Bears	team	I think hed be a great CB2 especially great considering he is pretty much the polar opposite of Fuller
fo47ypl	1587499746	Eagles	team	Wilson was a bust for GM Chris Ballard. He started 0 games in 2019, making only 11 tackles in 9 games.If he isnt traded, its also possible Wilson gets cut after the 2020 DraftA) Hes clearly a bust, so why would we want this kid on our team?B) If hes going to be cut, why would we trade for him?C) If hes that bad that hes going to get cut after 3 years and being a second round pick, see A.
fo47yw4	1587499748	Giants	team	Theres a reason why I italicized the word good. Then why I later went on to say he torched them.
fo47zgs	1587499756	Saints	team	Holy shit!! This Bucs team going from 88 to 97
fo47z0t	1587499750	Bears	nfl	Bill would make Tampa eat Gronks contract too. They cant afford to keep that money against their cal this year. They are already tight in cap room
fo47z9e	1587499754	Buccaneers	nfl	This is my last resort!
fo47zf1	1587499756	Falcons	nfl	And how does that hurt the Pats? Unless the Pats get a good pick it doesnt really matter as they are probably hitting a rebuild. Yet they still have older guys and are at an in between stage
fo47zh1	1587499757	Patriots	team	Thatd be an awful deal.  Gronk alone is worth OJa 2nd, and Thuney is worth wayyyy more than a 4th.
fo47zox	1587499759	Chargers	team	Were waiting...
fo47zoz	1587499759	Titans	nfl	Yeah, also Pick Six. If he had gotten them to the playoffs once, it would be different. But so far, hes been a big disappointment for where he was taken. Not saying Mariota has been much better, but he at least got them to the playoffs before petering out.
fo47zqn	1587499760	Chargers	nfl	If dolphins take tua, and giants take Simmons, I would be happy with Wills
fo47zs5	1587499760	Dolphins	team	New reports coming in from insiders saying everyone inside Dolphins staff claiming they actually dont even know who Tua is. Is that an XFL player?  Ross was quoted.
fo47ztr	1587499761	Patriots	team	Nah screw the 23
fo47zxm	1587499762	Broncos	team	Aqib is still one of my alltime favorite Broncos. Also I enjoy his reddit commentary.
fo47zkc	1587499758	49ers	nfl	Regardless of competition level, Luckman was the first serious, take snap from under center quarterback, and represented one of the first shifts away from the old singlewing formation into more modern offenses (t formation is archaic now, but introduced a bunch of modern concepts). He helped completely change the sport. That gets you legend status even with a war on.
fo47zpv	1587499760	Giants	nfl	This just seems a little too convenient.
fo47ztt	1587499761	Packers	nfl	This bipartisan report by the Senate Intel will surely convince my dad that Trump is only Russias puppet.  I cant wait for him to finally come to his senses, oh boy
fo47zui	1587499761	Seahawks	nfl	Yupp. And they ruined your uniforms lmao. Worst helmets in the history of the NFL right here.
fo47zod	1587499759	Patriots	team	Teams know we cant afford to keep him.
fo47zqp	1587499760	Bills	nfl	Idk, which of your super bowls hurt the... oh right....
fo48030	1587499764	Broncos	nfl	You guys are kinda both right, unless the launderer was using advanced cases.What happens in more advanced cases of laundering money through casinos, corrupt businessman purchase large sums of chips legally. These chips are then sold to criminals for their cash and the criminals can easily exchange the chips for cash after playing in the casino for a while, making the act seem natural and the criminal like another high roller in the casino.httpsejwagnercrimehistorian.comcasinocrimehowcriminalscleanmoneyincasinos
fo4808l	1587499766	49ers	nfl	NFC SOUTH! NO BREATHERS!
fo4805a	1587499765	Falcons	nfl	tom brady ruined my week
fo4809z	1587499767	49ers	nfl	I just cant understand how short sighted this is. I cant explain it to you any further. If you dont understand why were under stayathome orders and why community spread and how exponential growth works as it passes person to person, there is just no worth in having a conversation.Youre thinking is just as dangerous as theirs is. The only difference is your heart is in the right place, but you have ALL the wrong solutions.
fo480d0	1587499768	Patriots	nfl	Arguably the best way to use him the majority of the time, so he doesnt get hurt.
fo480fb	1587499769	Packers	nfl	He was pretty good after that httpsyoutu.beAkiIqKQMRlA this ones my favorite.(sorry for video quality)(sorry Chris Carter)
fo480lw	1587499772	Patriots	team	This is garbage. What, it wasnt fun enough before so you quit until Tommy went to go somewhere else and now you want back in? Im either forcing the Bucs to wildly overpay or Gronk can go back to wrestling. You dont get to call your shot like that.
fo480m2	1587499772	Vikings	nfl	Would you say David Tyree is a legend? Legend doesnt mean HOF or best. Its more about story telling.
fo480nl	1587499772	Jets	team	Oh cool so hell drop to 48 s
fo480hd	1587499770	Patriots	nfl	Give us Howard and 2nd
fo480lg	1587499772	Patriots	team	Thats why he did it. He doesnt want to play in NE clearly
fo480p8	1587499773	Chargers	team	Were waiting...
fo4813t	1587499779	Packers	nfl	You think he would have shown up to meetings just because it wasnt against the rules?
fo4811t	1587499778	49ers	nfl	Awwww. Dats hot. Dats hot.
fo4819j	1587499781	Patriots	team	Jeezus why cant they just rip the band aid off quick
fo481jg	1587499784	Eagles	team	He really fits what Schwartz does with CBs.
fo481nd	1587499786	Vikings	nfl	I feel like I missed the boat on doing presentations for my job. Was always a good public speaker in college, and have nailed the few Ive done for work. Just talking about stuff seemed like easy street, and I know its a skill most people dont have.
fo4812o	1587499778	Patriots	team	Give us Evans or Godwin then Ill be fine
fo481a1	1587499781	Bills	nfl	PAT MCAFEE FUCKEN CALLED IT
fo481hs	1587499784	Eagles	team	The team has literally already said that Jalen Mills will be replacing Jenkins. Im not sure I understand the need to draft a safety high or obtain a new one. Are we not willing to at least give Jalen Mills a shot? Dont forget Malcolm was a converted corner as well.
fo481iw	1587499784	Steelers	team	Howd that line of thinking work out for people relying on it last year?
fo481tc	1587499788	Bengals	team	Im down for a brand new one.
fo481w2	1587499789	Buccaneers	team	Thanks guys,  yea Ive seen mystic river, definitely one of thee best. Ill check out the kristen Stewart one
fo481wo	1587499790	Bears	team	He just uses a touch screen laptop as his tablet
fo4818w	1587499780	Patriots	team	If Im being totally unbiased, the Pats already got the best years (and thensome) out of both Brady and Gronk. Get whatever you can for the TE.
fo481hb	1587499783	Patriots	nfl	How do they have leverage? We are not planning on him playing. We literally do not have to deal him if we dont get a good offer. Sure, we wont get the moon, but I dont see how we dont have leverage
fo481p4	1587499787	Patriots	team	Can he just come out of retirement without the pats permission?
fo481ym	1587499790	Patriots	nfl	GIVE US WINSTON YOU COWARDS. The ultimate test of if it was the genius of Mcdaniels or if Brady is the true GOAT. I will gladly ride this roller coaster.
fo48209	1587499791	Patriots	team	We can. The math has been done. Restructure Gilmore and Hightower.
fo481xz	1587499790	Rams	nfl	WHATS UP!
fo48240	1587499792	Patriots	team	Does it? A retired tight end wants to come out of retirement as long as its to play with the GOAT QB who he has 10 year unrivaled connection with?
fo48291	1587499794	Browns	nfl	I dont know why people have such a hard time understanding that the dude didnt just smoke weed.
fo481t5	1587499788	Vikings	nfl	Gronk smash
fo481ys	1587499790	Dolphins	nfl	Im mad that Lamar is on the Madden cover solely because Ive been yelling at everyone saying he would be. Madden has now put the NFL MVP on the cover 3 times, 2 of which are this year and last year
fo481y6	1587499790	Broncos	team	Tua by far. If he goes to the Chargers and turns out to be great he can solve so many problems elsewhere on a roster. Having to face an elite QB four times a year would be brutal.
fo48203	1587499791	Browns	nfl	Not a good QB. But the consensus on him is that he was very raw and probably needed to sit for a season or two before being thrown out there. Regardless he would probably still be shit.
fo4822p	1587499792	Patriots	team	I would love to watch Brady and Gronk together again. Obviously I wish it were here but man we had 20 years of amazing shit, and we still have Belichick. I dont understand anyone on this sub. Yall are all so depressing. Brady and Gronk have never done anything wrong by the Pats. Let them have fun.
fo4823i	1587499792	Falcons	team	Joe Haden was pretty good, if we get Henderson and he was as good as Haden Id be happy with that
fo482ak	1587499795	Packers	nfl	Joey Bosa was a surprise?
fo482ft	1587499796	Buccaneers	team	88
fo482mw	1587499799	Eagles	team	Hmm, I know theres always 12 terrible people in every thread....there cant possibly be someone saying theyd boo Foles, right?scrolls to bottomOK, one person confused on wording, no one actually saying theyd boo.  Glad we can at least all agree on one thing.
fo482o1	1587499800	Patriots	nfl	what we think is a tackle is actually the linebacker pinning him
fo482o2	1587499800	Bengals	team	Uniform is a totally different thing then everything else. Packers, niners, chiefs, dare i say Steelers, shit even the celtics or the Yankees, are all great franchises both recently and historically that have had the same look for decades. Stick with a uniform long enough and it becomes classic and timeless. That being said i want new unis
fo4824z	1587499793	Seahawks	nfl	Just take OJ Howard in a straight trade. If Gronk truly does unretire, his money is back on the books, and that just aint gonna work.
fo482hl	1587499797	Browns	team	Yeah but unless were talking Simmons falling, theres no LB that makes sense at 10.
fo482vn	1587499803	Chiefs	nfl	Even OJ Howard straight up for Gronk is an overpay. Gronk looked shot the last time we saw him. Maybe a swap of 5th round picks.
fo482bl	1587499795	Patriots	nfl	Couldnt he have done this with the Patriots?Maybe not but this sucks ass
fo482kg	1587499798	Colts	nfl	Your flair should render you no respect
fo482y8	1587499804	Patriots	team	Me too. Its super gross, but OJ Howard and a second round pick would make me feel better about this.
fo48395	1587499808	Cowboys	nfl	I dont really think itll happen either but every Jets fan gets so defensive over it. Will definitely be funny to see the reaction if it does happen lol
fo482tv	1587499802	Chiefs	nfl	I would think a 5th would be a massive win here.
fo482yp	1587499804	Patriots	nfl	Exactly, better than nothing!
fo482vu	1587499803	Falcons	team	what did it say?
fo4831z	1587499806	Packers	nfl	Its not enough value and they dont need Gabe at all.
fo48390	1587499808	Chiefs	nfl	I hate the chargers...but damn these are tough
fo483c1	1587499809	Patriots	team	We have no leverage, if Gronk returns to NE the NE has to pay his salary. Wed rather get rid of him in a trade to the Bucs than pay him that salary
fo483fl	1587499811	Patriots	team	The leverage is we could just not and he wont play
fo483fu	1587499811	Lions	nfl	It was more giving you shit for calling him a sheep. Its ok to disagree but the name calling is unnecessary.
fo48383	1587499808	Patriots	nfl	No he wouldnt have because he was taking much harder drugs for the entirety if his career
fo483q5	1587499815	Panthers	nfl	Not sure why youre getting downvoted. Its entirely possible lol. All time greats in all sports are most likely using dope especially in the NBA where it seems their drug rules are non existent.
fo483qu	1587499816	Browns	team	Grass is green?
fo483rg	1587499816	Patriots	team	How do they have all the leverage if they dont make a deal they got nothing.. if they do they can compensation for a retired player lol. I would easily do Howard straight up
fo483ss	1587499816	Patriots	team	Pats would have to give up way more than that. Youre lookin at first and second for two years minimum.
fo48442	1587499821	Vikings	team	Pretty sure that New York radio guy who reported this was just looking for some name recognition
fo483ho	1587499812	Panthers	nfl	It will likely be even less my dude. Something is better than nothing
fo483j3	1587499812	Patriots	team	Jules is gonna be pissed.
fo483pv	1587499815	Vikings	nfl	Unretirement got their guy
fo483qe	1587499816	Buccaneers	team	Other than injury and him getting back in playing shape there isnt any.
fo483qz	1587499816	Vikings	nfl	We still have a shot at Dee Virgin lining up against Chad Beebe. The dream lives on!
fo483t2	1587499816	Jets	team	I dont get too caught up with it. Im more of lets see how this plays out in the next few years. Okudah could be the missing piece we need in our defense. And I want oline to be addressed but thats where good scouting comes in to find the good oline players in later rounds or the second.
fo483vc	1587499817	Chargers	nfl	No one would pay that much. Dumbass comment.
fo4848z	1587499823	Raiders	team	Scenario A with the Panthers is the optimal choice imo. Guardian to get that defensive stud. Can get a pretty good WR with the 2nd rounder too.
fo483yx	1587499819	Patriots	team	Now give us OJ Howard and a pick and nobody gets hurt.
fo484a0	1587499823	Falcons	team	A good pass rush beats good coverage any day of the week.
fo484cb	1587499824	Patriots	team	Hes not gonna play for us, so may as well get something in return.
fo484i4	1587499826	Vikings	team	No because if he dropped that far he probably has no bones left in his body
fo48443	1587499821	Vikings	team	This
fo4848l	1587499823	Cowboys	team	I am just happy I get to hear is voice while broadcasting. One of the most underrated QBs ever.
fo484bt	1587499824	Dolphins	team	I think he seems like a good fit, only question is the contract and what the Colts would want in return.
fo484ro	1587499830	Ravens	team	Murray goes top 20. Taylor goes top 40.
fo484sf	1587499831	Panthers	nfl	Turns out Gronks biweekly reminders that he wanted to come back were actually serious.
fo484uw	1587499832	Cardinals	team	Honestly, I really wouldnt mind trading back in the 1st to get a 2nd if we thought we could get Clyde EdwardsHelaire. By all accounts, hes a stud.
fo4849e	1587499823	Vikings	nfl	I think they look better because we can see what they look like, and arent hidden in a dark room with 78 camera cuts to showcase them.
fo484ev	1587499825	Saints	team	More like from 610 to 79
fo484kn	1587499827	Eagles	team	Booing my parents for giving birth to meThey ruined everything smh
fo484ob	1587499829	Lions	nfl	Hey my dad just died. Now heres a picture of my girlfriend, a Nintendo switch, and the Witcher. Please upvote me.
fo484r3	1587499830	Patriots	team	Feel the exact same way. I never blamed Gronk for walking away when he did, but for them to reunite on the Bucs just feels wrong.
fo484tn	1587499831	Bears	team	This is basically what Shaheens college tape looked likehttpsyoutu.bezgVvuOC7c
fo484vt	1587499832	Jaguars	team	Dave is very tech savvy so this should be a breeze for him, probably prefers being at home away from other peoples opinions 
fo484kw	1587499827	Jets	team	Im always biased to BC players but AJ Dillon is the absolute truth.
fo484m5	1587499828	Patriots	nfl	Gronk and Thuney for Howard and a 1st.
fo484ng	1587499828	Seahawks	nfl	Hard disagree they are atrocious lmao. Are you being serious?
fo484tv	1587499831	Patriots	nfl	Because Polomalu, his cover mate, was struck by the curse! Injured for the majority of the 2009 season, that years Madden (2010).
fo484vm	1587499832	49ers	nfl	No shit. Tom probably reached out to Gronk as soon as he signed
fo484yc	1587499833	Eagles	team	I drunkenly rewatched the superbowl again on Saturday night and he had such an incredible game.Really makes me feel bad about giving him so much shit this year, no matter how much he deserved it.
fo484y9	1587499833	Browns	nfl	Didnt Priest Holmes have one of the most dominant Offensive Lines ever? Or was that not always the case?
fo4855n	1587499836	Chargers	team	I hope we resign all our studs and make a run for it man its long overdue. I dont even care about what people say when I tell them Im a charger fan I just want that Super Bowl for all the fans that have been there through the good the bad and ugly.
fo48561	1587499836	Browns	team	Hes on borrowed time now imo. No team that thinks they have a special TE goes out and makes Austin Hooper the highest paid TE in free agency. I dont think Njoku was that special to begin with and I think hes being overrated because he got drafted by Sashi, so we should be trying to get something in return for him now before he walks for nothing.
fo485fj	1587499840	Patriots	team	I would think this was adorable if it didnt hurt so much.
fo484x9	1587499832	Colts	team	This reminds me of past comments Gronk made about the Pats culture.  httpswww.google.comampswww.bostonherald.com20191126tombradyrespondstorobgronkowskisayingpatriotsarenthappyafterwinsampIm thinking he wanted to play for Brady, but not for the Pats, so Gronk sees this as s golden opportunity.
fo484xz	1587499833	Rams	team	Those are the color rush ones and I actually really like them.  They look weird next to the others but they look pretty cool by themselves.
fo485j9	1587499842	Dolphins	nfl	Well, if you need evidence on why hes a former GM, here you go.
fo485ng	1587499843	Cardinals	team	Belgian fan here, Id love to see them too
fo485s9	1587499845	Eagles	team	Not Wilson, Hooker.
fo4854r	1587499835	Patriots	team	bruh watching Brady throw that fade to Gronk in Buccs uniforms
fo4859c	1587499837	Eagles	team	That was Nellys downfall
fo485ek	1587499839	Packers	nfl	Best QB to ever come out of Wisconsin
fo485ga	1587499840	Buccaneers	team	Good God. This offseason is shit I used to do on Madden.
fo485jl	1587499842	Giants	nfl	Dream scenario is trading down with the jags some how and getting YannickTop OL prospect and more picks
fo485ls	1587499842	Browns	team	Huh, so at 160 for the under, you cant even win 100 from this bet?
fo485pf	1587499844	Redskins	nfl	ah shit your write I goofed theyre.
fo485up	1587499846	Buccaneers	nfl	I mean, we said no to MBC...were picking our battles. lol
fo485yy	1587499847	Packers	nfl	Im no geologist but wouldnt we know if that kind of pressure was built up? And maybe, hopefully, excavate shit so that Yellowstone can let out pressure without blowing up? idk.
fo48664	1587499850	Saints	nfl	DONT GIVE A FUCK IF YOU GOT NO DEFENSE
fo486cm	1587499852	Jets	team	Listen, you seem really upset by it, but not once in this guys post did he say we were any better. Lol. I was actually pulling for the BiLLLLs back in the Flutie days. My college roommate was a bills fan, and my second favorite team is anyone but the patriots. I hope the patriots never win a fucking game again.I think everyone is well aware of the jets struggles of the last 20 years. Im 27. At this point, I almost take pride in the years of pain and ineptitude. Its basically all I have known since Sanchez left. Lol. Theres some hope right now, but Ill believe it when I see it. Still didnt stop me from going to Buffalo game.Worth noting Im also the guy in the Jets sub reminding people not to sleep on the Bills. Barring some catastrophe on either side, Im assuming well split wins for the next few years.I was honestly just surprised about the record thing when he found out about it. Makes sense tho. Pats had a long run, jets were decent, Miami back then too.
fo48606	1587499848	Patriots	nfl	My feelings exactly
fo48616	1587499848	Patriots	nfl	Anything is honestly
fo4865d	1587499849	Patriots	team	I want their first no matter what. Not trading a hall of famer for a 2nd and a TE they dont want
fo4865u	1587499850	Patriots	team	Fucking at a minimum.
fo4867g	1587499850	Bills	nfl	Robert Griffin III
fo4860x	1587499848	Buccaneers	nfl	They should? You seriously think the bucs are going to trade a potentially top 10 TE for a guy who has chronic injuries and hasnt played in over a year? If you think gronks value is higher than a 5th round pick youre seriously overestimating his value.
fo486sk	1587499858	Falcons	team	From ATL and on the  Florida Coast for the last 10 years. I dont want to watch this team on my local station. PTSD.
fo486ac	1587499851	Cowboys	team	so if your boss came to you and said hey we want you to take less than market value for your position youd happily take it?people see the big dollar amount and completely throw rational thought out the window it appears.
fo486it	1587499854	Cardinals	team	Also one is facing forward and the other is facing backward
fo486nk	1587499856	Titans	nfl	It does go both ways. I remember you could get on who would win The Ultimate Fighter. If you are unaware it iswas (IDK if its still a thing) a prerecorded reality show where fighters would face off once a week in an elimination tournament with the final two contestants meeting on a UFC event to determine the winner. Well there was a particular season which featured Kimbo Slice who was a internet celebrity streetfighter. There was a bunch of buzz about people wanting to see him in the UFC. But he had no actual mixed martial arts experience. That same season there was another fighter named Roy Nelson who had already been a champion in a smaller organization and had 3 losses (2 by decision) against UFC Champions. The guy was pretty much a ringer. Here is the kicker. The odds came out right as the show came on television. Its prerecorded. They already know the 2 guys fighting for the championship. The public just doesnt know. I knew. I knew one of the coaches. Kimbo Slice was 200 Roy Nelson was 400 Brendan Schaub was 800 (who Nelson fought in the finale)Kimbo Slice got eliminated the first week on the show. The max bet allowed was 250. I bet 250 on Roy Nelson and it was easy money. I imagine plenty of people knew but the books knew there would be plenty of suckers getting money on Kimbo for name value.
fo486qa	1587499857	Panthers	team	Quit playin with yer LittleDinghy
fo486qp	1587499857	49ers	nfl	SEPARATION!  CANT DEFEND!
fo486ut	1587499859	Patriots	team	Belichick needs to get off his ass right now and do some work. Trade Gronk to TB for 1st round swaps (14 for 23), then package that and a couple more picks to move up to 5 and draft Tua. Everyone wins.
fo48717	1587499861	Dolphins	nfl	So would this make more Pats fans jump ship and join the pirate Captain Tom Brady over to the Bucs fanbase?
fo486ka	1587499855	Patriots	team	Look I know he hasnt played in a year but Gronk is a hall of fame TE. OJ Howard isnt enough imo, talks should start at OJ and a first rounder.
fo486r8	1587499857	Texans	nfl	Getting a late pick is better than getting no pick.
fo48799	1587499864	Jets	team	Theyre not on the patriots anymore so Id be cool with it
fo486oo	1587499856	Patriots	team	Tbf he did say If true worst year of my life by far implying that this random sports thing is what would push it over the edge lmao

fo4873n	1587499862	Chargers	nfl	Imagine cam, with our wideouts, and a fit D with an actual LB in Simmons patrolling the middle of the field. Im gonna be so angry in a few years if Simmons is a worldie
fo487ga	1587499867	Saints	team	But again, I LOVE Gronk, but dude IS washed, and now hes no where near in shape. Granted that could change by September, but Gronk isnt a threat anymore.
fo4876v	1587499863	Browns	team	Mine arrived in DC today from the pro shop.

fo4877e	1587499863	Bears	nfl	How do you think the bears will manage their seconds?(trade updown)Do you have any ideas on who you think they might draft?
fo487b9	1587499865	Patriots	team	Fine just take the whole team while youre at it! FUCK! At first I was happy for Tom but now Im starting to get annoyed. This is like seeing your ex prospering and enjoying life without and with all her new friends and newly found singleness except its plastered all over social media and news and sports segments none of which you could avoid. I wish Tom would have retired as a Patriot. Gone off into the sunset. That would have been the most ideal situation. I was fine with Gronk being retired and being the goofball that he is and enjoying life but now seeing he wants to come back AND play for another team?? Fucking a.Theres no way they give up OJ Howard for Gronk, theyd be fools not to play with a solid 12 TE combination. Theyll give up something else.DAMMIT!
fo487f8	1587499867	Falcons	team	Personally, Id give up five of last years wins after the bye.
fo487oc	1587499870	Patriots	team	Alright honestly fuck this. Brady and Gronk are my two favorite Patriots. The way Brady left for Tampa made me lose some respect for him and if Gronk chased him to the Bucs, Id lose almost all respect since he teased us the ENTIRE season about making a comeback. Once theyre both retired for good Ill be much happier. Until then I cannot look at either of them the same way at the moment.
fo487u3	1587499872	Falcons	nfl	I have one of those ultra wide screen curved monitors myself, and yes, apparently its a gaming monitor.Cost like 2500 bucks but I didnt pay for it.Its at work. Got it through the company.
fo487zv	1587499874	Cowboys	nfl	The numbers and informef analytics disagree(httpsimgur.comaPyNWFyM)
fo48803	1587499875	Buccaneers	nfl	Thatd be a really bad trade for us. We all have every reason to think Gronk would only come back for one year before retiring again, whereas OJ will be turning just 26 during the season and has a lot of football ahead of him. Theres also the investment put into each player by their respective organizations. Gronk was a second rounder and OJ cost us 17th overall.Beyond that, BB tried to trade for OJ last season, so we have leverage. He wants OJ for the future and we want to win now. They would have to give up at least one of their shitload of picks in addition to Gronk.
fo4884s	1587499876	Patriots	team	So, this isnt gonna be popular, but Gronk has all the leverage if he wants to come back. How much cap space do we have? How much is his hit immediately if he unretires? No one will trade for him if hes just gonna retire again, which means the only ones who will do it are the Bucs. If only one team will trade for him, youre not getting a ton of return. So you either cut other players to keep Gronk if he returns, or you take what the Bucs offer to get him off the books. Whether the Bucs want to be nice about it is a different story.
fo4887u	1587499878	Patriots	team	Gronk for OJ Howard and a 3rd5th round pick would be good for the Pats. Something tells me theyll get less in return though.
fo488aa	1587499879	Bills	nfl	He doesnt want to play for yall, so he likely doesnt file for reinstatement unless his rights are traded. Thats why he hasnt done it yet
fo488el	1587499880	Jets	team	Finally a WR post I can get behind
fo487uq	1587499872	Browns	nfl	He could have been handled better. Dude was pretty reckless with his body though.
fo48863	1587499877	Eagles	team	I think hes talking about Malik Hooker, not Quincy Wilson
fo488gq	1587499881	Eagles	nfl	wait have pats not already done this to you?
fo488kz	1587499883	Patriots	team	I dont think teams can do that. Since pats have only 1 mil in cap and with gronk being due 10 mil they have to get rid of him which makes me believe the pats cant get much in return
fo488l1	1587499883	Patriots	nfl	Gronk for Brady straight up
fo488oz	1587499884	Jets	team	I love the optimism but hes not in that tier of player. Guys like Donald Ramsey Gilmore and watt have to be ahead of him
fo488q1	1587499885	Falcons	team	Watt, Campbell, Garrett, and Lawrence dont drop into coverage. Simmons can play center field and pick off passes or blitz up the middle and sack the quarterback. Hes much more athletic and has much more upside entering the draft than Beasley did in my opinion because of his hybrid abilities. I agree with your point that he needs to add more weight, somewhere around ten pounds, but comparing his weight to defensive ends that are only supposed to sack the quarterback is unfair.
fo48830	1587499876	Patriots	team	Wtfff !? if this happens Id Honestly feel like this is All set up...
fo4887s	1587499878	Patriots	nfl	Hes wrong like 80 of the time
fo4889a	1587499878	Patriots	team	  Anything less then a first is an absolute fleece. Yesterday was 420 bud.

fo488n4	1587499884	Cowboys	team	And yet the fanbase is larger than ever. The Cowboys are consistently the most watched, most talked about, and the most profitable franchise. Proof that at a certain point, superior branding creates a positive feedback loop.

fo48925	1587499889	Browns	team	Man that white looks sharp.
fo489gg	1587499895	Bears	nfl	given what we know, i think thats reasonable.
fo489il	1587499896	Chiefs	team	A great offensive line accounts for almost half of your offensive starters, so of course 12 of your offense being considered great is likely to lead to success, but were just talking about upgrading a single position, and no single position outside of QB is strongly correlated with winning.Taking pass rushers as an example, just 2 of the 8 passrushers selected to APs 2019 AllPro team made the playoffs (Cameron Jordan and DeForest Buckner). For comparison, 33 of the offball LBs selected to the AllPro FirstTeam made the playoffs, for what thats worth (Wagner, Davis, and Kendricks). So again, teams with a strong pass rush are probably going to do well just because thats 411 of your starting defense, but as a single position, pass rushers just arent that much more impactful than any other position.
fo48984	1587499892	Cowboys	nfl	PANTHER FANS, DONT KNOW WHY, EVERYBODY KEEPS LEAVING
fo489cc	1587499893	Patriots	team	Howard, a 2nd, and a 4th? Thats pretty steep.  I was saying Howarda 2nd OR a 3rd.

fo489gs	1587499895	Browns	nfl	And he didnt get fired until they started losing games.
fo489i8	1587499895	Vikings	team	Not disagreeing with the not elective part, but the hospital I live next to is not allowing anyone in the delivery room other than the mother out of precaution. Its crazy how much things have changed thanks to COVID19.
fo489ql	1587499898	Panthers	nfl	LeBrady
fo489t8	1587499899	Chiefs	nfl	The worst fucking year in the history of the world millenium.
fo489du	1587499894	Patriots	team	He wants to be with Brady. Not Belichick. Simple as that.
fo489lp	1587499897	Patriots	team	Because he retired, screwed with all the fans for a year about coming back when he never had the intention to do so, and once Brady leaves he wants to follow him so he can play with him but not for our team. I dont want another career long patriot to leave at the very end of their career, especially not like this.
fo489n6	1587499897	Patriots	team	If they dont give us at least a second rounder and than some tell em both fuck off
fo489nl	1587499897	Packers	nfl	I have a bias, but I will go ahead and guarantee that Jonathan Taylor is a steal in that range.
fo489og	1587499898	Bears	team	I could honestly see thanksgiving game be the opening game
fo48a2y	1587499903	Redskins	team	Correct, if they were, our offense wouldnt be averaging 16.6 ppg.

fo48aad	1587499906	Ravens	team	Purple head and all black uniforms? That just looks silly in my head. Im all about black uniforms but would maybe prefer the shield back on it.
fo489wp	1587499901	Ravens	nfl	I cant get mad this is a good joke
fo489xa	1587499901	Patriots	team	Yeah Im super salty at this point. As others have said, it literally is like watching your ex be happy with someone else.I dont want to be salty and spiteful but I am. I dont want to Bucs to do well. I want Brady to retire so I dont have to feel this way anymore.
fo48ah5	1587499909	Chiefs	team	We could debate that one all day but I see what you were going for and I can dig it.
fo48ai8	1587499909	Lions	nfl	I sold my dads heart to buy animal crossing
fo48abg	1587499906	Lions	team	I dont know why youre saying this like its fact
fo48agt	1587499909	Texans	team	On the other hand, if you accepted a contract with compensation that was mutually agreed upon, and halfway through decided to refuse to work unless you were compensated more, would that not be offputting? You realize teams put outs into NFL contracts so they can dump players before the contract expires if theyre not playing up to certain standards, right? I understand where Hop is coming from but its just weird to me.  It seems like the NFL is the only big 4 league where players do this. This is exactly the case, because the other 3 leagues operate with guaranteed contracts. In a sport where you are most sacrificing your longterm health, have the shortest window to earn, and can be cut by the team with years remaining, players will always be looking to adjust their pay closer to market value.
fo48aj5	1587499910	Browns	nfl	Not going to disagree. There was a reason Archie pulled the strings so Eli didnt end up there.
fo48aq5	1587499912	Broncos	team	Really appreciate these videos, they are great.
fo48aqn	1587499913	Eagles	nfl	I believe Gronk specifically said he would only play with Tom, so this would check out.
fo48a6w	1587499905	Patriots	nfl	Jealousy is a toxic trait
fo48a9a	1587499906	Patriots	team	Bro, you cant restructure them without giving them extensions. If youre doing that, youre potentially locking yourself into bad contracts cause they would have a ton of leverage in a negotiation
fo48axr	1587499916	Eagles	team	I dont have kids but if I did, without hesitation I would boo my firstborn child before Nick Foles.
fo48axt	1587499916	Seahawks	team	No I trust the experts over a blogger, just like Id trust a climate scientist over somebody who went outside every day and took the temperature and then declared climate change to be fake.I also played football myself through high school and the run game is what the whole flow of the game depends on you can feel the defense crumbling when youre running well. Play action honestly sets up the run game as much as vice versus because it forces the d to respect your receivers a little more. But I think especially in the pros you need both for the gameplan to work. The key is to avoid being one dimensional even if it seems like your passing or running game isnt working too well.
fo48aya	1587499916	Patriots	team	Were looking at best a 4th. Retired for a year, lost size and possibly football strength and has been extremely beaten up.
fo48ao3	1587499911	Packers	nfl	Shouldve been a red flag
fo48avt	1587499915	Packers	nfl	Arians has never been afraid to get rid of older players if he thinks itll make the team better even if theyre fan favorites
fo48aw0	1587499915	Cowboys	team	We are very popular, have a vocal fanbase, and have underperformed for a while. Thats why we get a ton of hate.
fo48aze	1587499916	Patriots	team	I wouldve liked silver home pants like before and the classic red alternates. Other than that I like the uniforms. Need a new look for the post Brady era.
fo48b6e	1587499919	Ravens	nfl	Uhhh a first would be WAY too much for Gronk...
fo48ava	1587499915	Giants	nfl	If the league accepts his unretirement then you cant keep a nonretired player on the ReserveRetired list. Theyd have to do something with him
fo48b86	1587499920	Lions	nfl	I wouldnt say nervous but I am feeling a little anxious I guess.
fo48bb3	1587499921	Patriots	team	I got roasted and downvoted to hell for suggesting this was possible a month ago
fo48bgc	1587499923	Raiders	nfl	I know what I said, that was the joke. Yeah, him and Mariota were both disappointments, but neither of them are busts. I was actually pretty jazzed about the Mariota signing. Hes a good hearted guy thats easily already one of the top backups. If something happens with Carr, I dont feel totally hopeless.
fo48bbw	1587499921	Falcons	team	well, were screwed
fo48bg0	1587499922	Raiders	nfl	Jim Brown
fo48bo4	1587499926	Cowboys	team	Meh.  Youre going to have to pay him.  Would rather just draft someone.
fo48bub	1587499928	Texans	team	I aint even worried. Fat chance in hell any Epenesa from Alabama or Iowa is sitting for us there at 40.
fo48bw4	1587499929	Patriots	team	We wouldnt get rid of his cap hit?
fo48bad	1587499920	Jaguars	nfl	It was such an obvious choiceI wouldve been stunned if they put anyone else on
fo48bde	1587499922	Cardinals	nfl	Its  not just Mahomes. Tyreek fucking Hill. You know hes running a streak and hell still dust youre whole defenseChris Jones also is Reggie White apparently
fo48bii	1587499924	Panthers	nfl	No way.. right?
fo48bju	1587499924	Patriots	nfl	Could probably get more than that. The Pats arent desperate hes costing them nothing. If the Bucs see Gronk as the final missing piece, Bill will ask for the sun and moon and theyll probably do that AND toss in a few more stars on top
fo48bkh	1587499924	Dolphins	team	Thomas is viewed as the 34 of the group though.
fo48bn2	1587499925	Patriots	nfl	Pats would need to add something else too, I cant imagine thats all it would take.
fo48bxo	1587499929	Patriots	nfl	Not a cap wonk but I see little to no way we couldve kept both himDmacJmac and Brady leaving was kind of a foregone conclusion
fo48bwf	1587499929	Seahawks	nfl	i think its mostly an easy goto for how could 2020 get any worse
fo48bxb	1587499929	Broncos	team	Thats our away and color rush away though We have 2 of them. Wheat are you smoking?
fo48bxe	1587499929	Rams	team	Makes the most sense this happens before the draft. If they dont release them until after the draft, it has to be due to the fact that they know the uniforms are bad.
fo48bzs	1587499930	Browns	nfl	Yup...
fo48c0p	1587499931	Jets	nfl	Eh I he just naturally slimmed down because it takes a shit ton of eatingworking out to maintain his playing weight, hes still in good shape and can probably put it back on by September, it was when people thought hed magically be able to put it on in a matter of weeks midseason that was ridiculous.
fo48c1w	1587499931	Cardinals	nfl	ThomasBecton with their first pick and trade back into the 1st for Love.

fo48cby	1587499935	Chargers	nfl	There was alot of talk about tackle being the pick.
fo48ccy	1587499936	Dolphins	team	Id be fine just getting a hog at 18 if one of the top tackles are still available. I wouldnt hate miami taking a QBs in the first round but if they wait and hurts falls, Id be fine with him in the 2nd round. There arent a lot of things I would be disappointed with in the draft except for trading away all 3 first rounders for a higher pick.

fo48crs	1587499942	Panthers	nfl	Im bad at speaking in general. Im much better at communicating stuff in writing.
fo48csy	1587499942	Broncos	team	Part of me wants this but with the old sky blue helmet color. But theres part of me thats like were 04 in Super Bowls in those unis, 31 in the 90s edglord look. As someone who at the exact same wing stop order for every win in the Super Bowl 50 run, I believe this absolutely matters.
fo48cdo	1587499936	Dolphins	team	Guys guys....we want Herbet. Shhhh dont ruin the smokescreen....
fo48cgk	1587499937	Bears	team	My washing does its job every Sunday without breaking down. Way too valuable compared to Shaheen.
fo48ci5	1587499938	Lions	nfl	Color me shocked if this happens
fo48cl3	1587499939	Packers	nfl	Is this a rendition of that band of brothers quote from one of the soldiers? The he mighta liked to hunt and I mighta likes to fish. quote talking about German infantry? I swear its so similar.
fo48cn4	1587499940	Patriots	team	no way. maybe a second round pick if were lucky. likely a 3rd and a swap up for us in the later rounds.
fo48cs2	1587499942	Raiders	nfl	I always tell people, whenever you read an article on ESPN where they say Vegas had a bloody day, its because they took a sidehad significant uneven money.httpswww.espn.comchalkstoryid13653044lasvegassportsbookslosebigopeningnflsundayhttpswww.espn.comnflstoryid8596367lasvegassportsbookstookbigbeatingweek9nflseasonhttpswww.espn.comchalkstoryid25181697costlyweek9nflsundaydisastersportsbooks
fo48csd	1587499942	Panthers	team	I heard they were looking at Henderson.  We are too.  This may be why there are rumors about them jumping into the top 6.
fo48cov	1587499940	Cowboys	team	right?  people always bring up that well never win with a qb making this much, and completely forget we didnt win with a qb making pennies.
fo48cpw	1587499941	Patriots	team	YOOOOO FUCK THIS SHIT RIGHT HERE!!!!I am willing to sacrifice winning to prove a principle. Were not the fucking raiders you dont just pull out the rug under us. Either fleece the buccs and rape them in a trade or let him rot.
fo48cxr	1587499944	Lions	team	It still hurts until this day but Detroit vs everybody!
fo48d5j	1587499947	Texans	nfl	Leonel Messi.
fo48d8d	1587499948	Bears	nfl	Walter Payton
fo48d13	1587499945	Eagles	nfl	Yup and the first 5 WRs taken were busts (Braylon Edwards, who did have a couple solid seasons and one great one, but nothing special from pick 3, Troy Williamson, Mike Williams, Matt Jones, and Mark Clayton).Another crazy factoid is that despite that draft being 15 years ago, there were still 8 players from that draft that are still active NFL players on a roster in 2020 (Alex Smith, Thomas Davis, Aaron Rodgers, Frank Gore, Richie Incognito, Dustin Colquitt, Robbie Gould and Cameron Wake)
fo48d21	1587499946	Buccaneers	team	Trade O.J. for gronk and a 3rd?
fo48d2j	1587499946	49ers	nfl	Wow didnt think everyone was so low on him. Then I think late first would be a steal
fo48d3t	1587499946	Eagles	nfl	An underweight oftinjured retiree isnt worth a 9 pick 1st round jump. gtfo
fo48d48	1587499947	Packers	nfl	never forget.
fo48d76	1587499948	Packers	nfl	Seems like an overpay
fo48d9j	1587499949	Patriots	team	BYE BYE traitor. Go play with the greatest of all time traitor (GOATT) in Tampa. Have fun losing. Thx for the draft picks you will get us though. We swap 1st round picks with the Bucs and they give her their 2nd rounder. Else go pound sand Bucs.
fo48di7	1587499952	Jets	nfl	I would love the NFL a little less if that happened
fo48d4x	1587499947	Saints	team	Gronks cartilage in his knees are gone, dude cant stay on the field and honestly he shouldnt.
fo48d53	1587499947	Patriots	team	Not mad at all. We will get a good haul for Gronk.
fo48d6r	1587499948	Redskins	team	Imagine the shitstorm on this sub if Skins trade out of 2.  No matter what the haul was, it would be a bloodbath here between two sides lol
fo48do0	1587499954	Patriots	nfl	Id honestly be a bigger Bucs fan than Pats fan next season if this happens lol
fo48d4h	1587499947	Seahawks	team	I think he just wants out of Jax real bad. Im sure if he was here we wouldnt be seeing him act like this at all. It is unprofessional but it is what it is.
fo48dmw	1587499954	49ers	nfl	Now im hungry againhttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vHq2kmbI1EA
fo48doz	1587499954	Dolphins	nfl	How can he regret something he didnt stick around to see?Regrets it now?  Regrets it then?  Regrets taking Ronnie Brown second over Aaron Rodgers in 2005?  Or how about the 2006 draft?  He might be a great coach when it comes to assessing and getting college talent, but his ability to put together an NFL team was shockingly bad.  Of the 14 draft picks made when he was HC only 1 started more than a handful of games, Ronnie Brown.
fo48dp6	1587499954	Steelers	nfl	This is literally, the dumbest thing I have ever read.
fo48dq5	1587499955	Bears	nfl	This is the correct answer, interpret it however you like
fo48dso	1587499956	Patriots	team	Hes certainly not that now. Hes closer to broken than HOF.
fo48du1	1587499956	Buccaneers	team	LET YOUR NUTS HANG BOYS
fo48dwv	1587499957	Patriots	nfl	Pele or bust!
fo48dwu	1587499957	Patriots	nfl	In my dreams maybe
fo48e11	1587499958	Cowboys	nfl	Everyone remembers the Super Bowl one Julio had, of course, but I think this one(httpsyoutu.be5Lm5SJR3T0) is even nuttier.
fo48dju	1587499952	Redskins	nfl	Something to note  escape artist is one of the dumbest superstar abilities in Madden. If your QB has it, he basically has 99 speed behind the line of scrimmage. If your actual 99 speed QB doesnt have it, hes running in molasses. So dumb.
fo48dqe	1587499955	Buccaneers	team	Because we also have Brate.
fo48dtc	1587499956	Seahawks	nfl	For a guy that wont even play for NE theyd be lucky for a 3rd.
fo48dx3	1587499957	Packers	team	I was at this game too. The whole mile long walk back to the car ( fuck fedex field) I was ranting about how it was time to blow it up and rebuild. I was wrong
fo48dz1	1587499958	Patriots	nfl	One more asset is better than no asset. This is good news for Pats fans.
fo48e0u	1587499958	Cowboys	team	I remember where I was during that play, but have no idea where I was during any other play. Another negative play that stands out is this...  httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vjj3q4aIvQ8(httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vjj3q4aIvQ8)
fo48e25	1587499959	49ers	nfl	i mean this would probably actually work.
fo48du3	1587499956	Chargers	nfl	Setup could not have been bettet
fo48efk	1587499964	Giants	nfl	Win win win
fo48dys	1587499958	Ravens	nfl	Im sure the Patriots would love that trade, but its an overpay. Gronks career was injury riddled, hell be 31 this year so its only going to get worse, and he hasnt been in football shape since 2018.Whatever you give up to acquire him, figure itll only last a year or two. Id put his value at a 4th rounder.
fo48eee	1587499964	Browns	nfl	Jerry Rice
fo48eky	1587499966	Lions	nfl	Barry
fo48emc	1587499967	Jets	nfl	DO IT BUCS. Tua will not be there and well be able to see years of Pats misery
fo48e6a	1587499960	Giants	nfl	Leroy is a bad boy with no blue check mark unlike his sellout owner
fo48e7y	1587499961	Buccaneers	nfl	Yeah nah
fo48ed1	1587499963	Buccaneers	team	Nice.
fo48ejl	1587499966	Dolphins	team	I know... thats why I said my bad and explained in the post your replying to why I made that assumption.
fo48eu2	1587499969	Seahawks	team	Have half the players dressed up as Mets and the other half as Calves.
fo48exw	1587499971	Lions	team	Nobodys going to trade up and with the Lions because they already ready no theres no chance theyre taking Tua.  So if youre Miami why would you trade up whe you know hell be there at 5?
fo48eyj	1587499971	Giants	nfl	Giants have plenty of needs on defense, but they could also use LT and C.  Gettleman typically takes BPA and doesnt trade back, but is there a scenario you see where the Giants could trade to address both the OL and the defense?  We probably go CBFS late and havent drafted a LB in the first since Jesus told Peter to fish on the right.  Thinking we go LT with 4 but wouldnt be surprised with a DT or maybe Simmons.
fo48ehp	1587499965	Bears	nfl	no u
fo48ejo	1587499966	Jaguars	nfl	Uncle Rico
fo48eoy	1587499968	Cowboys	nfl	You dont say
fo48ev4	1587499970	Colts	team	Im only ok with it if we get a 2nd plus a 4th. Thats the least Id be ok with dropping a first round pick that many considered a steal that we only got because of other teams drafting position. I still consider Malik Hooker player that was worth at least a top 10 pick in the draft. You dont drop a guy like that 3 years into his contract unless youre blown away by the offer, or if hes a bust.
fo48f0j	1587499972	Falcons	nfl	Not necessarily. Especially for the Pats who arent premier drafters but rather Fa scavengers. Bucs offer a 7th any team can offer a 6th and itd be better. Gronk cant veto a trade. Hes either in or out. The op I commented on said for literally just Oj Howard straight up too....
fo48f6n	1587499974	Buccaneers	nfl	Jim brown
fo48f9b	1587499975	Buccaneers	nfl	There is NO way that happens. Come on, NE has zero leverage here. Gronk has said he only wants to play with the Bucs (well, I dont know what he actually said, but the talking heads said it). Theyll take a 5th and like it.
fo48f09	1587499972	Lions	team	Extend Kenny and probably Decker first and foremost
fo48f2g	1587499973	Chargers	team	Important post thank you
fo48f2n	1587499973	Buccaneers	team	Brate just restructured his deal, seemingly to stay with us. It would be all time dick move to do that to him  Howard trade rumors prior to this just makes it seem like itll be Howard on the move rather than Brate.
fo48f9t	1587499975	Raiders	team	Everyone wants to trade down except Cincinnati  and Miami
fo48far	1587499976	Eagles	nfl	Thats no good. Walk as far as you like, you know hell find you.
fo48fbx	1587499976	Raiders	nfl	Bleacher report and everywhere
fo48fqu	1587499981	Dolphins	nfl	Time to find out if Danny Dimes is really 3li in disguise.Nothing else is going to stop this train.
fo48fen	1587499977	Patriots	team	(
fo48fi7	1587499979	Patriots	team	Stop stop I can only get so erect. Corpse of gronk and 23 for 14 and like a 5th? Id take it.
fo48fqs	1587499982	Cowboys	nfl	Is this baseless speculation?
fo48g3a	1587499986	Ravens	team	Id want to get rid of the white pants. Maybe make the helmet flat in color not glossy.
fo48g4i	1587499987	Cowboys	team	Give Jarwin a chance.
fo48fty	1587499983	Chargers	team	No, thank you
fo48g9d	1587499989	Patriots	team	TUA TIME
fo48fsi	1587499982	Browns	team	Really going out on a limb with this one.
fo48ftj	1587499982	Packers	nfl	Hell be unstoppable  but if he keeps smoking weed he will also go unpaid...
fo48fup	1587499983	Eagles	nfl	I would cut Lichts balls off and feed them to wild animals if he helped the Pats land Tua
fo48g3m	1587499986	Jaguars	team	Minshew magic works whether or not we have an oline
fo48g6y	1587499988	Buccaneers	nfl	Youre right, but OJs big problem has been him not doing his job. Which BB wont tolerate.
fo48glr	1587499993	Eagles	nfl	If youre drafting one of the elite tackles in the draft you arent saving 15m in cap space.
fo48g87	1587499988	Patriots	team	Boop for Leroy
fo48gbw	1587499989	Redskins	team	We havent heard anything about offers since Bruce was fired either. I just dont believe were in a position to get anything better than a third for him at this point. As I said, its possible, I just dont see teams (especially one in a teardown rebuild like Miami) giving up that much for a guy on the wrong side of 30, who hasnt played football in a year and a half, and hasnt played 16 games since like 2013 because of injuries, and who is also looking for top3 tackle money from whoever trades for him. And that team would also know that Trent could easily pull the shit he pulled last year on us, and report at the 11th hour and then make up some shit about his helmet, so what the fuck leverage do we have? Again, I just dont see it. And from all the reports on the matter, everyone expects a 3rd at best.
fo48glp	1587499993	Bills	nfl	Unless he fails his physical, which is done by patriots doctors and Im sure they have credible reason to fail him (his knees). And again, why do you think he hasnt applied? Because he doesnt want to be in NE and he wont reinstate until hes guaranteed to be on another team.
fo48grz	1587499995	Steelers	team	The Bengals never should have canned Marvin Lewis.They were caught up in the idea he couldnt get them into the later rounds of the playoffs, instead of being amazed that he kept getting them there with the worst ownership in football hamstringing him at every turn.That five year run of playoff appearances with that shitty organization should have them building Marvin statues outside Paul Brown Stadium.
fo48gw4	1587499997	Patriots	team	belichick must be really mean at practice lol
fo48gec	1587499990	Buccaneers	team	The wild character of a championship team doing both at true same time has happened before
fo48ghe	1587499991	Chargers	nfl	Stupid Chiefs and they made it harder with Sexy Mahomes
fo48gkb	1587499992	Lions	team	Am I allowed to be mad at a trade that didnt go through?
fo48gwh	1587499997	Patriots	team	Except that OJ Howard is garbage
fo48h2x	1587500000	Lions	team	I think for full legality he should add bitch!
fo48gv4	1587499997	Patriots	team	Push the money down the road. Bill can do it.
fo48gvk	1587499997	Packers	team	Id rather trade for OJ Howard.  I dont see either scenario happening.
fo48h04	1587499999	Panthers	nfl	You dont get to be QB for 36 of a franchises existence if you suck though. That doesnt really change anything. The Panthers might lack the history of the 49ers or some other teams, but hes still the best QB weve ever had.
fo48h0p	1587499999	Vikings	team	Rumor is we want to go DLOL with our two picks. Well see if thats true or not, but thats what has been said about our preference for the first round this year. So maybe its more likely than people think!
fo48h1t	1587499999	Panthers	nfl	People expecting Gronk to still be elite are setting their expectations waaaay too high.
fo48h8h	1587500002	Rams	nfl	LMAO
fo48hg6	1587500005	49ers	nfl	Well you know what...Im glad Lawerence Taylor did all that cocaine back in his playing days..we wouldnt have had such a dominant player...man the amount of HOF athletes back in the day and the drugs they did lol you have such an innocent mind...people can play nfl for 10 years and do hard drugs if they wanted
fo48h8r	1587500002	Patriots	team	Luckily for you, me being a Lions fan since birth and a NE transplant, you wont have to worry about the Lions making anything out of those guys. Theyre toast as long as theyre in Detroit.
fo48hf8	1587500004	Patriots	team	Exactly, OJ Howard is a fucking beast. Id gladly take him and a pick.
fo48hjh	1587500006	Redskins	nfl	Id be surprised. I saw him on tv recently and he looks very out of shape.
fo48hl8	1587500007	Patriots	nfl	Florida is perfect for Gronk since he should be retired
fo48hmh	1587500007	Buccaneers	nfl	Absolutely fucking not. Is Bucky high?
fo48hnf	1587500007	Patriots	team	If all gronk wanted was to play with Brady why did he not come back earlier?
fo48hd3	1587500004	49ers	nfl	Better then him staying retired and you get nothing, not sure what hell bring with his inactivity and injury history but whatever it is its better then nothing
fo48hgk	1587500005	Bears	team	Thank you for the information. I was unaware the deal was restructured.
fo48hps	1587500008	Jets	nfl	Jamal was great in that game, but Sam still torched yall
fo48hyh	1587500012	Patriots	nfl	Tua isnt falling out the top 10.
fo48hpa	1587500008	Buccaneers	team	Are we getting Gronk? ARE WE GETTING GRONK?!
fo48hzp	1587500012	Patriots	team	I think Edelman would much rather prefer playing for a winning team.
fo48i7c	1587500015	Patriots	nfl	I dont remember, but he was in his 40s? Lol. Gronk doesnt even have to be the 1 let Howard take that spot. Limit snaps to prolong health, etc
fo48i96	1587500016	Packers	nfl	He wouldnt play in Tampa though either if Patriots dont like the offer.
fo48iax	1587500016	Patriots	team	Hate to see Gronk play in another uniform, but if they can get an asset of value, yeah, do it. Also, no Howard, hes a bum, rather have a higher draft pick in return.
fo48iew	1587500018	Ravens	nfl	Is Tom Brady like Aragorn or something
fo48ixk	1587500025	Patriots	nfl	In the world where the QB that just made your team relevant wants to play with him and in the world where that TE is the most dominant at his position and still in year 10 so not over the hill yet
fo48ilg	1587500021	Chargers	team	uCUnknownX, the paragraph. Paragraph, meet CUknownX.Ill leave the two of you to get acquainted. Maybe then Ill be able to read that wall of text in your post.
fo48in6	1587500021	Cowboys	nfl	Half Mexican actually.
fo48irs	1587500023	Patriots	team	And we all remember Gronk made the biggest catch of SB 53
fo48j67	1587500028	Lions	nfl	Bet you feel stupid
fo48j0b	1587500026	Bills	team	 He threw a football 72 MPH which is the equivalent to 110 MPH with a baseball. You keep saying that shit, but its not true. Its as much higher than a typical Combine throw as a 110 mph fastball would be in MLB, but theyre not the same thing. I dont need to prove that he cant throw 110 MPH. Youre the one thats making that ludicrous claim. Youre the one that needs to prove it. Like 4and1punt, Ive never seen him claim to be able to throw faster than 92 mph. You said he has multiple times. So prove it. You see, there are some fundamental physics issues at play here. With a football, strength is really important because of its size and weight compared to a baseball. With a baseball, which weighs much less, strength is still important, but technique is where you maximize speed. You need to create several synergizing whip actions at the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and fingertip to get to that kind of speed, But mechanically, there are some limitations to how much speed the human body can create. To throw a baseball 110 mph, you need to accelerate your fingertips to 110 mph with perfect mechanics, and thats probably not possible. It certainly has NEVER happened. Not even close. Aroldis Chapman is about as close as anyones ever gotten, at 105 mph, and even that is truly freakish compared to other highspeed fastballs throughout history. Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson... for most elite, worldclass fastballers, 101102 mph is a truly exceptional throw. Youre suggesting that a guy who hasnt played baseball since high school can just come out and outperform some of the greatest in history by almost 10. Its preposterous. I would be shocked if Josh could break 100 mph.
fo48j2v	1587500027	Eagles	team	I cant see fans booing Simmer.
fo48iz7	1587500025	Panthers	team	not the draft, but ESPN just said the Bucs are talking to the Patriots to get Gronk back with Brady.  They are in win now mode.  Gronk has one year left on his contract for 10 million.Would suck to see him and  Brady together in our division.
fo48j7w	1587500029	Raiders	team	Shut. The fuck. Up.
fo48jbl	1587500030	Cardinals	nfl	He wasnt a surprise really, but people had him mocked slightly lower, more of a 456 guy than a top 3.
fo48j2n	1587500027	Panthers	team	Wish we still had beane burrito with him
fo48j7l	1587500029	Bills	nfl	A defender
fo48jak	1587500030	Patriots	nfl	Never forget about the whole LeBron Phil Jackson posse incident
fo48jdx	1587500031	Patriots	nfl	Why? Im hyped
fo48jpk	1587500036	Cowboys	nfl	Jim Brown, but hes a terrible human.So, Jerry Rice would get my vote
fo48jvd	1587500038	Giants	nfl	Honestly for Tampa why not?  Hell I could even justify more than a swap.  Fully commit to a superbowl this year.  Not like they have to worry about Tampa either.
fo48j92	1587500029	Patriots	team	I got one Gronk Jules and pick 23 for Godwin, Howard and 45th pick.
fo48jbz	1587500030	Cowboys	team	Dont think hes much better than Jarwin.
fo48jf2	1587500031	Colts	nfl	Being a Pats fan is a toxic trait
fo48jl1	1587500034	Patriots	team	Dont want to play armchair GM, but Id hope a swap of first round picks is in play(at the very least)if this happens,  otherwise Bill should hold on to his rights for the season. This kind of BS(as much as I appreciate what Gronk has done for the franchise, and understand his chemistry with Brady) is irritating.
fo48jqb	1587500036	Chiefs	nfl	Oh look an actual bombshell story from Glazer.
fo48jso	1587500037	Buccaneers	team	If this happens yall are going to be scary as fuck
fo48jvh	1587500038	Jets	nfl	why the fuck would ancient injury prone Gronk be worth that much trade value?
fo48k4c	1587500041	Cardinals	nfl	If Gronk returns, I believe the Pats owe him 9MM. The Pats dont have that available. You either have to cut him or trade him immediately.
fo48jt9	1587500037	Vikings	team	Did I miss some sort of inside joke here??
fo48jwm	1587500038	Browns	team	I dont judge someone off one bad thing theyve done (unless its truly horrible). If that play was the only time Id have ever watched Myles Garret I wouldnt think hes a bad human being because that couple seconds of anger isnt enough to figure out what kind of person hes beenwill be.
fo48kjl	1587500047	Falcons	team	They are. But the Patriot unis are actually just their color rush jerseys. Like I said. They are growing on me. And Im sure Theyll look better in action. But, they didnt need to change our jerseys in the first place. Are these new uniforms better than the older unis? Nope. IMO they shouldve just brought back the all black version of the older jerseys. And called it back in black. I wouldve lost my shit as I think most wouldve. I will say. The new helmets are 
fo48klk	1587500048	Colts	team	Ballard always tells you exactly what hes going to do. You cant have watched that video  at the seasonending press conference and then decided that Hooker hasnt been in the doghouse.  I didnt even include Hookers January 9 tweet about a very, very bad day. That would coincide roughly with the timeline when Ballard would have been discussing player performance for the previous season. You think that Ballard didnt bring up those shots that he and Desir gave up to Hopkins? Ballard was visibly pissed just a week before.I dont know whether Hooker will be traded, but I guarantee that hell be traded if Ballard feels like the offer is good enough.You cant really look at Hookers tweets and arrive at the conclusion that Ballard hasnt at least discussed the possibility of trade with Hooker, going back to midFebruary.I think theres probably an even chance that Ballard has deals on the table that are contingent on particular players being unavailable.  Sort of a we might give you pick 27 for Hooker depending on the availability of two players that were not going to specify.Look at the expression on Ballards face when hes asked about the Hooker extension. I really get the idea that the we that Ballard is talking about isnt Ballard and Hooker, but Ballard and the media who will be discussing the direction that the Colts are going there.The writing is on the wall, if you look for it.
fo48kmp	1587500048	Lions	team	A run stuff DT is not better than the best lockdown corner in this draft.
fo48knn	1587500049	Patriots	team	please let this come to fruition.
fo48k85	1587500043	Buccaneers	nfl	Gronk. He could block, hit, catch. Do whatever you need.
fo48kfm	1587500046	Rams	team	Ramsey, Cooks, and Willie Hayes are missing
fo48kq3	1587500050	Buccaneers	team	Hes gained back weight, and has taken his physical for Tampa. Injuries are still a problem, but maybe his CBD stuff will help.
fo48kre	1587500050	Browns	nfl	Fuck theyre nice
fo48k9n	1587500043	Vikings	nfl	Wed make a great team.
fo48kh2	1587500046	Titans	team	If he had a third hed have a pretty awesome setup for a flight sim.
fo48ky2	1587500053	Patriots	nfl	2020 keep being wild
fo48kta	1587500051	Patriots	nfl	YES. GET US THE FLYIN HAWAIIN!
fo48l4v	1587500055	Raiders	nfl	Oh my god, YTA. Youre being gaslighted into the DunningKrueger Effect. Classic narcissist. So much cognitive dissonance. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Not wholesome, 010.
fo48l5a	1587500055	Buccaneers	team	gronks not on the cap right now.  world is so damn crazy.
fo48l7j	1587500056	Patriots	nfl	Theyre saying 9 spots for Gronk. Gronk and 23 for 14.
fo48lan	1587500058	Browns	nfl	Man how are you a fan of the Texans and you dont even know how many games they won since BoB took over?Jeff Fisher had six winning seasons in 22 years. BoB has had five winning seasons in the past six. Get this trash take out of here.
fo48ktx	1587500051	Broncos	nfl	He should have made us wait 24 hours
fo48l4c	1587500055	Patriots	nfl	Gronk and a 3rd for the TB 2nd round?
fo48lcz	1587500058	Lions	nfl	Windows key  left or right will also work
fo48l34	1587500055	Jaguars	team	DiRocco just took Kinlaw at 9 on the ESPN mock draft with the team reporters, with every WR available but also Jedrick Wills which would be awesome value. I expect nothing and am still let down.
fo48l6u	1587500056	Patriots	team	Youre fucking delusional.
fo48lp2	1587500063	Broncos	nfl	Good luck. Youll probably end up with a 6th or something
fo48lf6	1587500059	Patriots	team	big time. all the delusional people thinking well get Howard AND high round picks too... I thought this sub was more sensible than rNFL but sometimes its hard to tell haha
fo48li9	1587500060	Patriots	team	Gronk couldve come back last year to play with Brady when we needed him.
fo48lu4	1587500065	Colts	nfl	Wasnt it suspected to be Tunsil before he gasmasked it?
fo48lep	1587500059	Chargers	team	Only complaint is that they dont have the vapor jerseys for sale on the store.
fo48lo9	1587500062	Saints	nfl	 Im a little too excited that CJ Henderson has a worst case scenario that overlaps the Saints draft slot, but screw it, only 2 more days and Im going to run with it.
fo48lto	1587500065	Patriots	team	You can considering his options are play for the pats which he obviously wont want to do so hell stay retired, or get them to trade him. Pats have all the leverage.
fo48ltr	1587500065	Saints	nfl	God fucking DAMNIT
fo48lvs	1587500066	Colts	team	Hasnt Holder already said theyre just taking calls, not shopping?
fo48m01	1587500067	Patriots	team	Its almost like Ray Allen leaving at this point.Brady is leaving for..Rob Gronkowski, Goodwin, Howard, Evans.
fo48lzi	1587500067	Patriots	team	Hows that not tampering if we still own his rights?
fo48m2t	1587500068	Patriots	nfl	I would rather have Howard
fo48m4p	1587500069	Panthers	nfl	Bradford had the extreme fortune to be literally the draft before the CBA introduced the rookie wage scale. He then had the fortune of having nonmajor fluke injuries occur a few times thus jettisoning him from his original team and then he had the fortune of other QBs getting injured at exact points in the offseason for him to cash in. His potential was so tantalizing teams couldnt help themselves and he never had to deliver to get another deal. Astounding right place right time type of situation for his career.
fo48mcd	1587500072	Falcons	team	Gronk is coming back to the league and possibly being traded to the bucs
fo48lx3	1587500066	Rams	team	I do agree with your point dont be mad about something you have no control about its true I really shouldnt. However going off of the Taco Bell thing, its a bit different. Ultimately the Rams can do whatever they want, but one thing I believe that holds true for all sports, especially football, you want to represent your team, wear their colors, show off their merch, etc.My issue is 1. The logo is gross and majority of the fan base would agree.2. As a fan base we feel lied to and going unheard.Its hard for me to support and represent my team when they truly are disrespecting the fans by not even acknowledging us. People keep talking about this 5 year change with the logo, the team hasnt even addressed the issue. They just dont say anything and act like there isnt a riot in the comments of every single post. As a fan of the team, how can I represent and support my team when they wont listen to the fans who are upset about the representation(the logo) of our team!
fo48lzo	1587500067	Dolphins	nfl	Im not that surprised at all to be honest
fo48m55	1587500069	Raiders	nfl	Whaaaaaaaat
fo48mf1	1587500073	Packers	team	Well I feel very validated in saying I was disappointed by MVS.  I was so pumped on him, and he just did not deliver.
fo48m4l	1587500069	Vikings	nfl	you failed comprehending this tweet
fo48m84	1587500070	Patriots	team	0100
fo48man	1587500071	Ravens	nfl	Jay Glazer BOMB
fo48mpu	1587500077	Vikings	nfl	How good is he?Somewhere between 15 and 131...
fo48mrq	1587500078	Broncos	nfl	Expect they lose 10 million dollars that way.
fo48m5d	1587500069	Lions	team	No way this team would pay OJ, James, and Hock starter level money
fo48mlr	1587500075	Bills	nfl	Yeah, and what if we lost? What if we lost the civil war and chattel slavery stayed in place? Now, wed have a bunch widows, and a newly formed country that protects slavery in its constitution!All Im saying is that violence isnt the cure all people seem to think it is.
fo48mc6	1587500072	Buccaneers	team	Gronk is a WWE guy now so hes probably running OrlandoTampa already
fo48mjl	1587500075	Patriots	team	Howard, plus any of Kmet, Trautman, or Bryant, a good WR in the draft, and our offense is right back on track. Then all it would come down to is our qb play.
fo48mlk	1587500075	Patriots	team	If we can trade gronk (who was a shell of himself in his last season) for howard, thats not the worst tbh.
fo48n25	1587500082	Panthers	team	Doesnt even matter by the time were relevant most of these guys will be gone (Brady,Brees,Gronk)
fo48moo	1587500077	Dolphins	team	Being a first round talent from the talking heads is different than being a first round talent. I dont see him going top 15, and wouldnt be shocked for him to fall out of the first entirely
fo48mrx	1587500078	Patriots	nfl	Its not a first for Gronk. Its swapping a first for another first for Gronk.Thats a big difference.
fo48my3	1587500080	49ers	team	I really love every thing about Amik Robertson  except the fact that hes maybe 59. I dont know if the Niners pick him  because Kwaun Willimas has the slot locked down, but I like him a lot.
fo48myl	1587500080	Patriots	nfl	Jay Tune in tomorrow at 11 pm Glazer?
fo48n0g	1587500081	Buccaneers	team	Gronk has always been a party guy. But hes yet to make any kids. So I dont see that happening just because he moves to Tampa.
fo48mts	1587500079	Panthers	nfl	Im sure if I even bothered to bring it up to my dad hed say that the people who came to that conclusion are deep state operatives and its fake news.
fo48muh	1587500079	Patriots	team	I would be ecstatic with this, if not though I wonder what Tampas round 2 looks like if they have multiple maybe just replace 14 with their round 2 picks
fo48mvv	1587500079	Bills	nfl	Lmao hes never going to escape this
fo48nc9	1587500086	Lions	nfl	Could they just do Gronk for OJ straight up? Maybe pats throw in a 5th?
fo48ngp	1587500087	Raiders	team	Too much.  Im not interested in giving away 2nds and 3rds when Mayock is running the show
fo48muq	1587500079	Patriots	team	Give me OJ too and this would be great.
fo48n2n	1587500082	Patriots	nfl	Hes not saying a first outright. Hes saying they swap spots.
fo48n9l	1587500085	Chiefs	nfl	Why the hell would TB do that? Gronks gonna retire when Brady does, right? And beyond that, Gronk hasnt put up an elite season since 2017.
fo48n3q	1587500082	Patriots	team	I mean to be fair he got asked basically the moment he retired to the last day he was allowed to rejoin the team last year. He wasnt ever brining it up, why not have some fun with it.
fo48n8o	1587500084	Patriots	team	Por que no los dos
fo48niw	1587500088	Vikings	team	Viking
fo48njx	1587500088	Seahawks	nfl	Might wanna recalibrate those odds lol
fo48nmq	1587500090	Patriots	nfl	Its not a first, its a swap of 9 spots. Still dont think it happens (and I dont want it to happen)
fo48nsu	1587500092	Patriots	team	Zzzzzz... putz
fo48o0r	1587500095	Titans	nfl	For sure. Most of us Titans fans are rooting for him to succeed, except when you guys play us. He just has to get his groove back, and getting the GMHC combo that he has, who both believe in him, should bode well for his future success.
fo48o2g	1587500096	Patriots	team	Sources Buccaneers discuss Rob Gronkowski trade with Patriots  By ESPN   nbsp  The Patriots and Buccaneers are discussing a trade involving Rob Gronkowski, a deal that would reunite the retired tight end with Tom Brady in Tampa Bay, according to ESPNs Adam Schefter and multiple reports.  nbsp  Gronkowski has one year and 10 million left on his contract with the Patriots, and the teams have talked a trade ahead of Thursdays NFL draft.  nbsp  Im back! I apologize for my absence Patriots fans!  Join the resistance, dont give ESPN your clicks! And thank you for helping make me one best bots on reddit! (current rank 36 thanks to 2 jerkoffs)(httpsbotrank.pastimes.eu) nbsp   Love FuckESPNBot
fo48nlb	1587500089	Patriots	nfl	So, Brady, hows your sex life?
fo48np0	1587500091	Buccaneers	nfl	We are either going to the super bowl or this will be a dream team disaster. No in between.
fo48nrc	1587500092	Patriots	team	This was his plan all along. Both him and Brady were done playing for Bill and wanted to play for a players coach. They out Belichickd Belichick
fo48nrz	1587500092	49ers	nfl	Kelce was easily better starting around 2016 or so. Gronk had 14 total TDs his last 3 seasons. He missed too many games to even be considered the best at that time.
fo48nyz	1587500095	Lions	team	Patriots and Bucs get this trade done before the draft giving the Patriots more ammo to move up in the draft to get a top QB
fo48nzp	1587500095	Bears	team	Get the funk out of my face. Get. The. Funk. Out. Of. My. Face.Jackie Moon
fo48o54	1587500097	Patriots	nfl	It depends on how much the Bucs think Gronk helps and how much Brady wants him. The Pats dont have to do anything
fo48o8d	1587500098	Packers	nfl	Mostly meant its never been easy. Probably getting my ninerscowboys narratives mixed up... oh how the turns have tabled
fo48nt6	1587500092	Panthers	nfl	At least 5. I think he may have had a 3 year prime though.Hes a weird comparison. Hes kinda the poster child for burns hot and fast.
fo48o7a	1587500098	Rams	nfl	3 way trade.Bucs get GronkPats get Brian Allen  OJ HowardRams get a new logo.
fo48ob7	1587500100	Cowboys	team	Cool, hope theres a spot in the trophy case for all that meaningless bullshit
fo48o0d	1587500095	Eagles	nfl	Yea the pats have no leverage I mean wont you guys have to cut players just to afford keeping gronk? I was arguing with a pats fan a week or 2 ago and he swore gronk would never do this to you guys. Cant wait to find that comment.
fo48obg	1587500100	Vikings	nfl	I think his point is it would be a lot easier to trade up to 5 or 6 from 14 rather than 23.
fo48odb	1587500100	Buccaneers	team	Right but if gronk wants to play again the pats dont want to pay him
fo48oim	1587500102	Dolphins	nfl	Holy shit.
fo48okt	1587500103	Patriots	team	Even Tom taunted everyone with the commercials and IG stories and shit. That Hulu commercial was a fucking jab if Ive ever seen one. I thought for sure he ran that ad as a sign he was coming back.
fo48ooa	1587500104	Raiders	nfl	If they swap firsts for Gronk. I. Will. Lose. It.
fo48os0	1587500106	49ers	nfl	And? Ofc he didnt just smoke weed lol Im sure he drank, did blow and whatever else..but guess what so have many other athletes that have done far worse and for a long period of time, basically their whole playing careers.
fo48oap	1587500099	Ravens	team	I just dont want us to screw it up like NE and Atlanta, so personally Im fine with what we have. Maybe some tweaks but generally I like what we have. Black on black is an elite combo, color rush is a great alternate, and we have the ability to combo purple, white and black shirts and pants.
fo48odt	1587500101	Patriots	team	gotta be a first
fo48oha	1587500102	Buccaneers	nfl	Im not a doctor but I would totally conduct Gronks physical. LETS FUCKIN GO! TOMPA BAY GRONKENEERS, BITCH!
fo48opt	1587500105	Patriots	nfl	Yeah theyd have to throw in Tom Brady too.  Wait...
fo48ouc	1587500107	Patriots	team	then hes not gonna play football at all unless the bucs give up a high draft pick
fo48ok1	1587500103	49ers	team	If all three of the top receivers are on the board, we likely will take Lamb and walk away. Saying thanks.
fo48opr	1587500105	Chargers	nfl	Three year deal with an out after one. Make a balls in run. Thats the cam play imo Not unexcited about tyrod. Just think cams a better version of him.
fo48ou9	1587500107	Bears	team	Id much rather see how it plays out with Trubisky and Foles so I agree the picks should be spent on other positions.  I honestly think theyll just go BPA when theyre on the clock.
fo48opu	1587500105	Chargers	team	He stay!
fo48oxc	1587500108	Redskins	nfl	Theres a certain term for that, I believe. Its unfair that my memory isnt working. Must be all this changing weather.
fo48p01	1587500109	Raiders	team	Im on board with this
fo48pav	1587500113	Buccaneers	nfl	That video gave me a seizure
fo48ov8	1587500107	Browns	nfl	Just your standard 10240x1440p dual monitor setup.I dont like it because its less screen space than 2 4K monitors, he couldve had a 3rd 4K and saved desk space and have had double the screen space of his current set up
fo48p1g	1587500109	Raiders	nfl	Gonna take a lot of heat for this. But am I the only person thats not a fan of players basically deciding what team they get to play for by demanding it andor throwing massive temper tantrums? Maybe Im biased from the AB situation but it just seems so childish and petty. Whats stopping the NFL from becoming the NBA with 2 or 3 super teams and 30 teams that have no chance whatsoever if this becomes the norm. Not to imply Gronk is throwing a hissy fit like AB or Ramsey but it just seems like its a slippery slope and most people seem to be on the players side no matter what.
fo48p45	1587500111	Bears	nfl	He wont fall past 10
fo48p86	1587500112	Ravens	nfl	Guys, the way 2020 has been, this honestly is expected What a wild year
fo48pbu	1587500114	Bears	nfl	When I read this a shiver went down my spine. Imagine.
fo48pk8	1587500117	Packers	nfl	This wasnt a laziness thing, like you said, its still in the game.They thought people didnt want to sit through it. Which is also dumb, considering the announcers poke fun at you if you skip the waste of time they call a halftime show
fo48pom	1587500118	Colts	team	Why are we watching the same person sidebyside? I dont get it.
fo48pr3	1587500119	Panthers	team	Its unreal to me. Love Luke, love Mills, but Smitty is the greatest panther ever.
fo48ps1	1587500119	Buccaneers	nfl	Dude holy shit what?
fo48pt1	1587500120	Buccaneers	team	This is the strangest timeline.
fo48pur	1587500121	Rams	team	Every time it pops up on NFL network it looks like a placeholder for a yet to be released rebrand. Its garish and upsetting.
fo48pyd	1587500122	Vikings	team	We would need salary, so it means we either1 flip Harris for a similar price we trade for Thuney, and then address secondary with at least 2 of our first 3 picks, at a minimum. Or 2 trade up using Harris to draft Okudah or Henderson (Cleveland is about the only potential partner for this)Or 3 3 way trade something likeMIN receives Joe ThuneyCLEWASJAX receives Anthony HarrisNE receives 3rd rounderOr 4 trade Reiff and draft ClevelandJones with first rounder.I think its good value for him, pick wise, but we cant keep the pieces we got the way it stands currently. Caveat Anyone who says they oppose Thuney but wants us to draft Ruiz in the first and teach him to play guard at the NFL level via Zoom is crazy.
fo48pzb	1587500122	Steelers	nfl	Everyone GET IN HERE
fo48prz	1587500119	Cowboys	nfl	Literally cannot go tits up.
fo48pu9	1587500120	Patriots	nfl	Why?
fo48q60	1587500125	Buccaneers	team	Gronk. Creamsicle. Jersey.
fo48pud	1587500121	Steelers	nfl	TB isnt giving up their first for out of retirement Gronk. A 3rd, maybe. Tua is going to Miami.
fo48q2e	1587500124	Saints	nfl	Its very obvious that the falcons new all white takes inspiration from the saints (non color rush) all white
fo48qb9	1587500127	Vikings	team	I also cant remember a time weve come into the draft with the amount of capital we have this year. I could see this year being the time we break it (after all, last year was the first time under Spielman we took someone in the first round that we didnt have a top 30 meeting with, so hes apparently fine with bucking trends haha)
fo48qj2	1587500130	Patriots	nfl	Okay.
fo48q51	1587500125	Cowboys	nfl	Hell be there at 31 for you
fo48qdu	1587500128	Patriots	nfl	Solid logic.
fo48qo7	1587500132	Broncos	team	Or its just my opinion. Someone prefers navy over powder blue. Wow. Imagine that. How impossible
fo48q8k	1587500126	Falcons	nfl	Its funny cause Glazer actually shot down this story on PMT (who broke the news two weeks ago)
fo48q9l	1587500127	49ers	team	I mean, TT really hasnt done shit. Hope he and Hurd can come back and impress this year.
fo48qa5	1587500127	Patriots	team	Gronk probably saw the writing on the wall and thought it wasnt worth it
fo48qco	1587500128	Patriots	nfl	Hes a Panthers fan. Hes swearing because Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski are in his division now.
fo48qhw	1587500130	Patriots	nfl	Lol yes they do, if Tampa actually wants him they literally cant get him without a trade. That is leverage.
fo48qk9	1587500131	Eagles	team	I do, and I would. Hed love it, because kids are fucking stupid.
fo48qy2	1587500135	Lions	team	Jeff Okudah because somehow everyone is nihilistic about Brown
fo48qkn	1587500131	Vikings	nfl	But does he have coronavirus, Jay?
fo48qm6	1587500131	Patriots	team	Follow Up Tweet  Bucs close to getting Gronk RobGronkowski tells me. Bucs waiting on word of physical. Still thinks to iron out but should be good within 24 hours(httpstwitter.comJayGlazerstatus1252692108458131457)
fo48qw3	1587500135	Patriots	team	Red pants are a bit too much
fo48r4y	1587500138	Browns	nfl	Its less common in the NFL, especially when you are a star player.I dont think thats true. Most coachplayer relationships are pretty similar to a typical bossemployee relationship. They may get along and enjoy each others company, but theyre not hanging out in the offseason or anything.
fo48qvk	1587500134	Colts	nfl	TB already has 2 good TEs. I doubt theyre in a rush
fo48qz1	1587500136	Vikings	nfl	But does he have coronavirus, Jay?
fo48rc4	1587500141	Packers	nfl	NFL Insider Leroy had this weeks ago
fo48qwe	1587500135	Patriots	team	Richard was usually the best player on the field in his prime, just an absolute monster.
fo48qzt	1587500136	Patriots	nfl	NE could also not trade him.
fo48r9p	1587500140	Buccaneers	team	I just bought a Brady and Vea jersey . Do I have to buy a Gronk jersey now?
fo48raa	1587500140	Panthers	nfl	Bradford had all the potential in the world. We never got to see his ceiling. There was a time in his career he legit looked like the best young QB of the league and a future hall of famer.
fo48rbu	1587500141	Patriots	nfl	.... do we trust glazer?
fo48rdm	1587500142	Titans	team	Good shit thought he played well towards late
fo48rgg	1587500143	Cardinals	nfl	Hes not going to be good lol
fo48rh0	1587500143	Browns	nfl	Your thinking of that Super Bowl ring already arent you )
fo48rmv	1587500145	Patriots	team	How do we have leverage? We cant afford to pay Gronks last year on his deal so our options are a trade for something or a release for nothing... even if we wanted to shop Gronk we really cant since he wants to play with Brady and will just stay retired if we try sending him anywhere else.Id argue we have no leverage at all... we should be quite happy to get any compensation for a guy we didnt plan on having anyways.
fo48rqf	1587500146	Patriots	nfl	Enjoy the Gronk
fo48r42	1587500138	Lions	team	Trade down to 5, pick Simmons.
fo48r5e	1587500138	Patriots	nfl	Not really, if Gronk wants to play for the Bucs the Pats have to remove him from the retired list and trade him.  They can just hold onto his rights if the price isnt worth it.
fo48r5i	1587500138	Seahawks	nfl	What is going on
fo48rcg	1587500141	Broncos	nfl	WOW
fo48rev	1587500142	Ravens	nfl	Gronk is going to go way too early in fantasy drafts
fo48ri1	1587500143	49ers	nfl	I mean weve both made the NFC Championship game 4 times in that time span.  While its obvious Green Bay has been much more consistent, I wouldnt say theyve been much more successful.  Plus as competitive as he is, theres no way he is cool with being 46 against them is all Im saying.
fo48rlk	1587500145	Patriots	nfl	Who that, and what he say?
fo48ro3	1587500146	Patriots	team	Couldnt agree more, if he hung it up and retired Im fine with that. We saw a lot of the offseason news last year about his health which I sympathize with but at the end of the day he just didnt want to play for Bill anymore and tried rolling his personality over into another career outside of football (again thats fine) however that failed. So now hes leveraging his situation to come back and play, it seems like it was all a farce. Trade his rights and move on. Hopefully they can get a 2nd or swap firsts NE gets 14 TB gets 23.
fo48rcx	1587500141	Falcons	team	True, but Im comparing him that way because thats what satisfies the greatest need. Atlanta doesnt need a third linebacker, not as pressingly as it does another pass rusher. His body is more suited for a.linebacker, yes, but that doesnt capitalize on what Atlanta needs right now.
fo48rka	1587500144	Giants	nfl	TOMPA BRADY
fo48rlv	1587500145	Bengals	team	I want the all blacked out uni with orange stripes someone posted here a few months ago. It was glorious.
fo48ro7	1587500146	Rams	team	Absolutely!
fo48rpz	1587500146	Raiders	team	All fair.  End of the day Im not going to be disappointed if we take one of the big three WRs, or if theyre all gone, one of the defensive studs that fell
fo48s86	1587500153	Titans	team	Lets pretend his name is Jadaveon
fo48rnd	1587500145	Bills	nfl	Mahomes has almost the same rushing attributes as Josh Allen, but with Escape Artist he is like a cat and Allen moves like a battleship
fo48s3w	1587500152	Buccaneers	team	Nah dont feel empty, we had our fun and its exciting to have uncertainty in our football future with bill leading the charge.  The if we can get OJ Howard out of this it would be a winwin for both teams
fo48s5a	1587500152	Chiefs	nfl	Yes if there werent other teams that could take him. Pats dont have to trade him to Tampa. If he truly only wants to play for Tampa, his options are play nice for the trade or retire.
fo48s5k	1587500152	Jaguars	team	He is left out of any discussion on who the best rookie qb was except when brought up by jags fans.
fo48s8f	1587500153	Buccaneers	nfl	EVERYONE STAY FCKING CAL! fuck, its Glazer.
fo48sbz	1587500155	Patriots	team	OJ and a 2nd or 3rd would be nice
fo48s8o	1587500153	Patriots	team	Me too.Ad was literally like your wife telling you she loves you and is super happy then leaving the next morning lmao.
fo48s96	1587500154	Buccaneers	team	Im fascinated by the compensation given the Patriots have no leverage. Obviously in a vacuum Gronk would have high value but Im guessing just a late round pick and maybe Howard?
fo48sjo	1587500157	Broncos	team	Josh McDaniels?
fo48s2i	1587500151	Vikings	team	I mean I would consider bad footwork part of you rmechanics lol
fo48s48	1587500152	Buccaneers	nfl	TOMPA BAY GRONKENEERS LETS FUCKING GO!
fo48sbn	1587500154	Lions	team	Okudah at 3.As much as I want to trade with Miami, I just dont think a deal gets done. Im also going to be completely wrong because I have yet to correctly predict anything that Bob Quinn does in a draft.
fo48sxx	1587500163	Packers	nfl	Please credit Leroy
fo48t3c	1587500165	Patriots	nfl	I think you have no leverage as well, though. You getting rid of Howard without getting another TE would put you in a rough place. If were only gonna get a mid round pick, its not really worth it for us over sitting on it for longer to see if he unretires from us. A 30 chance gronk unretires for us is better than a 10 chance we get someone in the 4the or 5th that is better than a backup
fo48t46	1587500166	Patriots	team	Def dont need another 3rd we already got 3 of em but if they giving us that Ill take it . The fucker  already took the physical lmfao. I want OJ  Howard and that 2nd lol!!
fo48t4k	1587500166	Texans	team	None of what you said matters. Its all about VALUE BoB wants to get in return to make these moves. Not happy with a Clowney? Fine. Not happy with Hopkins? Dumb, but fine. At least get good value back if youre gonna move him. Why youd think that idea is bullshit is beyond me. Stop apologizing for BoB. I dont understand why you and others on this sub have tried to come out here and explain how we are getting better and are set up better for the future. None of BoBs moves have made any value sense.

fo48t4x	1587500166	Dolphins	team	by some, that doesnt necessarily reflect how this front office feels
fo48t7b	1587500167	Falcons	team	We NEED LBs in this draft. Would like us to double dip and would hope there was a strong pick to be made in the third. LaRoy Reynolds shouldnt be seeing meaningful snaps for us in 2020.

fo48sqq	1587500160	Eagles	nfl	Why did this one stay? It was posted later
fo48t0j	1587500164	Dolphins	team	Herbert is not a good qb. Sloppy footwork, sloppy mechanics, cant read defense, has literally 0 touch. Hes a developmental qb, but Love and Season are also developmental QBs who have less issues and higher ceilings.
fo48tba	1587500168	Lions	nfl	That dork has been the nicest guy in Hollywood for too long. Have you ever seen Tom Hanks and the Ayatollah Khomeini in the same room at the same time? I rest my case.
fo48thg	1587500171	Chiefs	nfl	No drug testing in the new CBA and his advocacy for the cannabis industry. Might not be that far fetched as an input into his decision.
fo48tji	1587500172	Jets	nfl	in what way is a retired TE worth that much? fuck off
fo48syu	1587500163	Vikings	team	Bikes.
fo48t45	1587500166	Chargers	nfl	fuck the lakers
fo48t5j	1587500166	Titans	team	I like it! Solid 5th CB that can be used for a 4th CB if needed. The way to build a great roster is having a good back half of the roster!
fo48t5p	1587500166	Patriots	nfl	Belichick trades himself to the Bucs.  Checkmate.
fo48t5u	1587500166	Ravens	nfl	Hes still got a body made of glass, and hes going to be 31 this year. I dont feel like Gronk is going to dedicated himself to the Buccaneers, I think he just wants to fuck around one more season with his pal Tom and hang it up.
fo48t6u	1587500167	Rams	team	To be honest, I dont like any color rush unis (including our banana suits), so it really wouldnt matter how they did them.  I have seen uglier than these though, Ill give you that..
fo48t8a	1587500167	Steelers	nfl	Too much. Swap Brate and Gronk and call it a day. Win win for both sides

fo48tm2	1587500173	Panthers	nfl	Thats still too much
fo48teb	1587500170	Chiefs	nfl	We waited years for this. Hes not going anywhere.
fo48tl3	1587500172	Patriots	team	As Patriots fan Ill hate to see either in a Bucs uniform but as a football fan and a fan of both players I cant wait to see some more Brady to Gronk connections
fo48tr7	1587500175	Dolphins	nfl	Theyve never made the obvious choice before. They did OBJ the year after the Malcolm Butler play, they did Sherman the year after Peyton broke every passing record. Hell, they did Gronk after Cam won the MVP. Theyve only just started doing MVPs the last few years

fo48u7c	1587500181	Broncos	team	I agree, we have had close games (never said we didnt) and I agree he will play worse when he gets his big payday because they wont be able to pay those around him (never said other wise) .I said he wasnt a mobile quarterback... he an amazing arm.

fo48uha	1587500185	Raiders	team	I disagree with most of what was written. Im not sold on brown, hes a DT that cant rush the passer. Hes not Aaron Donald, and didnt always dominate in SEC play. I cant see any way Simmons or okudah is there at 12 but yeah sure if that crazy scenario works out take one of themNo team in the top 7 Is goin to take 1219 for top pick AND a 2nd. I think we are more likely to trade 12 back to a late 1st and 2nd. I do get drafting a CB at 12 IF the guy they love is there and using 19 on a WR, yes top 3 are gone but at 12 Henderson might still be available (most peoples CB2)So then it becomes so they want Henderson at 12 and maybe Jefferson at 19 (or some other WR) Or choice of Jeudylambruggs and maybe Fulton at 19
fo48unt	1587500188	Dolphins	nfl	Holy shit.  We went from Gronk is gaining weight for a possible return to Gronk has passed his Bucs physical in an hour.
fo48ut9	1587500190	Patriots	nfl	Incredible, thank you! Also, thank you for coming by and doing this its been a long dark offseason.
fo48ufl	1587500184	Buccaneers	team	Or move on from Brate and rock pme of the best TE duos of all time.

fo48uxp	1587500192	Patriots	nfl	Surprised we arent hearing this today and not tomorrow at midnight
fo48uyy	1587500192	Packers	nfl	Yeah the guys who set the odds are well informed and know what theyre doing, otherwise sports betting wouldnt even exist. They must know something that we dont about a deal being all be signed.
fo48v1i	1587500193	Jaguars	team	Yes, move him to RB and have a two headed dragon with Lenny and Cam
fo48v47	1587500194	Panthers	team	I dont know why, but I couldve swore he drafted Luke too. Didnt realize he was a gettleman pick.
fo48v49	1587500194	Raiders	team	Thats insanely worth it. Wtf is this sub and ppl saying dumb shit
fo48uu1	1587500190	Buccaneers	team	Has he? I havent really paid attention other than what he posts on Instagram. He was looking really really skinny there for awhile.
fo48uud	1587500190	Lions	nfl	Getting a pick like that is delusional thinking, Gronk was a shell of his former self his last season and its been over a year since then. You guys might get a sixth at best for Gronk IMO.
fo48v15	1587500193	Colts	team	Senior bowl and captain. Sounds like a Ballard guy to me
fo48uzl	1587500193	Patriots	team	From what Ive seen theyd only have to free up 200k for him, which would come from cutting LaCosse.
fo48v0x	1587500193	Redskins	nfl	since when are you a Packers fan?
fo48v31	1587500194	Chargers	team	What about the hole at LB? I think thats a bigger hole than OL as of now. OL needs have been addressed and met in FA, but there was nothing done to address the needs at LB. I do think that QB can be addressed in rd 2, but I think LB has to be addressed over OL.
fo48v6z	1587500195	Patriots	nfl	Im so excited
fo48vga	1587500199	49ers	nfl	Glazer shouldnt be posted anymore after that bullshit he pulled
fo48vix	1587500200	Bengals	nfl	Seems like a tough position for the Chargers. They want a franchise QB but if they dont draft one now then theyll probably be drafting in the 1525 range next year since Tyrods good enough to get them to the fringe of the playoffs, if not first round of.
fo48vl5	1587500201	Browns	nfl	I never said you were excusing anything, I asked you to please take note that many other people were. It is those other people OP was talking about.
fo48v6m	1587500195	Patriots	team	HHahahhahahahaI love how you started your response totally levelheaded and rational, and then asked for a combination of three things that we couldnt even get one of individually. I would be surprised if we do any better than a 4th or 5th round pick for Gronk. Like you said, we have absolutely no leverage
fo48v7a	1587500196	Patriots	team	TUA AND OJ, THE BAMA CONNECTION
fo48vag	1587500197	Falcons	nfl	They owe him guarantees regardless. And for OJ whod theyd have to pay in a year or let walk? Itd literally be gifting Gronk to Tb for nothing or even a net loss.If they get a pick, thats different. Everyone is ignoring the guy literally said OJ and not even a pick.
fo48vax	1587500197	Patriots	team	They have Cameron Brate, and Howard is not solid at all. Hes a major underachiever.
fo48vbj	1587500197	Panthers	team	Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck this
fo48veq	1587500199	Browns	team	Never forget the golden rule of draft week.  Every rumor you hear is BS.  If someone is leaking information, its for a reason.  If this is true Id be very disappointed in our front office.Unless its double BS ... httpsyoutu.beUeZmEiyTo0(httpsyoutu.beUeZmEiyTo0).  Then its brilliant.
fo48vjb	1587500201	Titans	nfl	What a whirlwind this is.
fo48vje	1587500201	49ers	nfl	I wonder if Randy Moss is planning on returning just so he could play with Brady again s
fo48vjf	1587500201	Patriots	team	The second we trade for a pick, Goodell will drop the hammer from that investigation and take it away.
fo48vvd	1587500205	Patriots	nfl	Patriots have all the leverage, they dont need to trade him at all
fo48vhm	1587500200	Jaguars	nfl	Still a lot has to happen for that nightmare to come to fruition
fo48vr1	1587500203	Panthers	nfl	Hey, lets be fair here. Those were rapes.
fo48vvg	1587500205	Texans	nfl	I love Flash but this is a terrible take.

fo48wdk	1587500211	Buccaneers	team	In your dreams.
fo48wj7	1587500214	Packers	nfl	Also leads the league in WTF Does That Mean tweets.
fo48wj9	1587500214	Patriots	team	They either agree to trade him, or they release his rights.If he comes back they would have to rework a number of deals to fit him, and he may still try to weasel out.
fo48wno	1587500215	Raiders	nfl	I feel like we do anyways. Chargers and Raiders might have the two best in the entire league, Chiefs have a classic, and Broncos at least have cool colors. I might be biased but I think the AFC West is clearly the best.
fo48vyt	1587500206	Buccaneers	team	GRONK!!!!!

fo48wai	1587500210	Patriots	team	Why does Gronk owe the Patriots undying loyalty? He already has. Belichick tried to trade him.  Business is business goes both ways.
fo48wcp	1587500211	Patriots	team	Exactly. I get how people want to get compensation for him since he wont play for us either way, but I cant bare to see him in another uniform. Especially after Brady just left us. I honestly hope we cant reach a deal
fo48wmm	1587500215	Seahawks	nfl	Oof, youre one of the prison warden Panthers fans huh.
fo48wjj	1587500214	Bears	team	Pro Bowlers like Justin Tucker arent facing real competition, they just sign another kicker for training camp to keep the starters leg fresh
fo48x12	1587500220	Patriots	team	Why does Gronk owe the Patriots undying loyalty? He already has. Belichick tried to trade him. Business is business goes both ways.
fo48x1a	1587500220	Seahawks	nfl	Ya thats how trades work. But the difference is that the Patriots wont be getting a player back if they dont like Tampas offer so theyre better off accepting a 7th round pick cause then at least they get something.
fo48x21	1587500221	Patriots	team	keep dreaming
fo48x2m	1587500221	Bears	nfl	Free OJ Howard? Where can I get one pls
fo48x3b	1587500221	Titans	team	Nice.
fo48wki	1587500214	Buccaneers	team	Been hard since Mid March my guy.
fo48wob	1587500215	Broncos	nfl	I too would like a free OJ Howard
fo48wt6	1587500217	Patriots	team	He doesnt count against the cap as long as he stays retired.
fo48wz2	1587500220	Browns	team	Bell is a Bengal now and Apple was almost a Raider but still a FA.
fo48x2i	1587500221	Eagles	nfl	The Juice is shooketh.
fo48x53	1587500222	Patriots	team	We can afford to pay him. Have you read any reports about restructuring and extending peoples contracts for salary space?
fo48wli	1587500214	Vikings	nfl	Glazer tends to be good besides that fuck up last week.
fo48wt1	1587500217	Seahawks	nfl	I took the afternoon off because Lil V was having the worst day and I had a video meetingSo, of course, shes taking the nicest, longest afternoon nap ever.Whatever. I did some yard work and now my arms are made of lead.
fo48wy2	1587500219	Patriots	team	They dont have to activate him. Hes on the reserveretired list, so until the Pats activate him from that list, his salary doesnt count.
fo48x4f	1587500222	Packers	nfl	Well the new jacked up fines and made them mandatory. So he can play for whoever they trade him to or not play at all. So if he comes back and Patriots dont get an offer they like he will either stay retire, play for the Patriots, or do nothing but get fined.
fo48xes	1587500226	Buccaneers	team	I dont understand peoples obsession with keeping oj. If it gets Brady his top security blanket then theres no downside. If gronk gets hurt and doesnt play or produce then hes literally the same as last years oj, BUT its gronk. Gonna sell jerseys, be fun to watch, and is most likely gonna be great
fo48wzk	1587500220	Panthers	team	Yeah, but also the Bucs arent allowed to have nice things
fo48xkx	1587500228	Packers	team	Yeah, probably. I really love Reagor Mims and Higgins though. Ive heard a lot about how deep this class is for WRs, but I didnt really get it until I broke down all the top prospects. After Lamb and Jeudy, its really hard to decide which ones I like the best.
fo48xlk	1587500228	Buccaneers	nfl	Right, so hold onto a player that is not going to play for them and not get any compensation? Come on. Pats have no leverage.
fo48xov	1587500229	Patriots	team	This whole offseason has just been fucked. I hate 2020.
fo48xr2	1587500230	Patriots	nfl	Wtf
fo48xvh	1587500232	Eagles	nfl	WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING, they both wanted to get away from belichick lol
fo48xws	1587500232	Saints	nfl	Pleasantly surprised with the navy blue
fo48xdg	1587500225	Bears	nfl	I think its gonna happen(httpstwitter.comrapsheetstatus1252684831357632518?s21)
fo48xep	1587500226	Buccaneers	team	Nah, Pats fans here.  Now that Brady is gone, I dont have any interest in an aging Gronk with a year off catching passes from Stidham.   I want to see him in Tampa Bay, Im rooting for the Bucs (and Pats) this year for Brady, but Pats are rebuilding.   As a Boston sports fan, the biggest loss this year was Mookie Betts.  Brady is way more legendary of course, but hes going on 43 and we were not going to win with him in our current state and I expected to lose him.  Betts is a generational talent in his his prime.  I dont think too many Pats fans are salty, even the ones like me who wanted him back.  He earned the right to play for the Pats until 60 in my opinion, would have been happy to see us lose if Brady wanted to stay.  But he didnt and hes gone.  As a kid I couldnt even imagine the Patriots appearing in a Super Bowl, and this man won us 6 and took us to 9.   I will ALWAYS root for him.

fo48xlt	1587500228	Chargers	nfl	Dumbest trade Ive heard of in a while.So Gronk, who was constantly hobbled towards the end, has retired for over a year, and has no actual contract in place...is worth the equivalence of a 2nd and 3rd or 4th round pick?
fo48xol	1587500229	Buccaneers	team	if he would come back to the pats im sure theyd clear the space have to be crazy not too.  im sure hes made it clear hed ponly play with TB.  He has said that before.  Almost got traded to Detroit but said hed quit before play with another QB.  Oj and a 3rd or 2nd next year.
fo48xox	1587500230	Cowboys	nfl	In 2016? No. That offense was all Zeke and the Offensive Line. Had they lost one or two games in that streak, theyre still in the playoffs with Romo back in his spot.OT loss to the Eagles or losing to the Steelers and Romo gets his spot back week 910 and theyre a better team. And if Romo is hurt again? The question is answered and were on to Dak without lingering questions. And they lost in the 1st round against the Packers. They had the 30th ranked secondary. They made a great come back and fell short...after Dak dug a hole in the first half and couldnt move the ball. Looking good against prevent defense doesnt make you great. Cant tell me Romo wouldnt have sustained drives in the 1st half better that game.
fo48xr7	1587500230	Patriots	team	I mean being in Tampa probably helps too, gronk spends half his time in Florida
fo48xuc	1587500231	Bengals	nfl	He sounds like the best of the OTs imo.
fo48y25	1587500234	Rams	team	Lol. I read that as an acronym. I was like.. what the fuck does GAP stand for? I thought it was some European soccer team or something
fo48yby	1587500238	Patriots	team	A deal may be in place already but who knows this shit is happening so fast
fo48yeu	1587500239	Patriots	nfl	Well, considering that the Bucs were trying to trade OJ Howard, and Brady absolutely LOVES Gronkowski, I could see them moving for him, and then moving Howard either in that trade or during the draft.
fo48yg3	1587500240	Patriots	team	I like seeing all of the options! Silver pants (although maybe a lighter shade than shown here) would be a great add
fo48yi6	1587500240	Bears	team	Fire up the !!!
fo48xxr	1587500233	Saints	team	I think the addition of Malcom Jenkins as a veteran presence will help solidify our secondary. Plus if we draft a Linebacker who can handle some coverage roles wed be okay  we had Demario and reserve guys against the 49ers and we just plain crapped the bed against the Vikings.
fo48xxz	1587500233	Buccaneers	team	Is anyone else seeing the delusional trade offers that pats fans think they will receive for his rights? I saw a reporter say we would offer pick14 AND OJ howard??
fo48xz0	1587500233	Cowboys	team	Jesus you would think half of you commenting on this are married to Romo. Its not like the video is cgi. It happened and Romo never went far in the playoffs. But facts  triggered Romo fangirls so keep commenting things that are in no way related to the post.
fo48y03	1587500234	Eagles	nfl	Pats have to cut players just to afford gronk he has all the leverage. TB will lowball and the pats almost have to trade him to them otherwise he will retire again.
fo48yap	1587500238	Titans	nfl	rtruth agrees
fo48ydl	1587500239	Buccaneers	team	So do we put a tricorn hat on Bruce or just put the knife in the old Patriots logos mouth?
fo48yjt	1587500241	Falcons	nfl	Im not listening
fo48yk7	1587500241	Titans	nfl	Probably, Tunsil was probably going no.1 to us before the Rams unloaded for Goff
fo48ynh	1587500243	Lions	team	The Redskins have two big problems right now1.They have an incredibly weak roster. They have a great DL but after that they have 1 good WR in Terry McLaurin, a couple decent RBs, 1 decent CB in Kendall Fuller, an iffy QB in Dwayne Haskins, and ... thats really it. Aside from Fuller, they basically took in some of our castoffs and not much else this year in Free Agency. Their DL was not a problem last year and adding another DL wont fix the other problems in the defense and the roster as a whole. The thing I see most brought up when Redskins fans say theyll draft Young is having a better DL will give the Secondary help, which is true... if your DL was mediocre to bad before. Adding somebody to your one stacked position will have little benefit.2.They have a dearth of early picks and 7 picks as a whole. They have 2 overall and then their next pick is in the third round at 3.02. After that they pick at 4.03 and 4.36. Then 5.16. No Sixth. Then 7.02 and 7.15. With mediocre at best free agent signings, theyd be going into next season with basically only two new starters (Chase Young and Fuller) after losing a couple starters to free agency. They would likely be in the exact some spot this time next year as they are this year. Maybe thats what theyre going for if Ron Rivera wants either Trevor Lawrence or Justin Fields over Haskins or Tua. The amount of picks they have also may change if they trade Trent Williams, but as of right now only the Browns have been rumored to make a move and they seem to be worried about contractinjuriesagedraft compensationetc.They will almost definitely take Young but I just dont think they would be making the right choice.
fo48yo1	1587500243	Eagles	nfl	Sending him behind Kittle isnt exactly freeing him...
fo48y6f	1587500236	Colts	team	Hes got ... NO CHANCE IN HELL!!
fo48y8l	1587500237	Cowboys	team	And yall call me a Romo hater.
fo48y91	1587500237	Chargers	nfl	No problem. The Chargers website is calling it Navy, but it feels darker than that to me.Whatever it is, it looks sick!
fo48ybv	1587500238	Bears	team	So what you are saying is he hasnt drafted these positions often?
fo48yf6	1587500239	Patriots	team	Hes a hall of famer period. Im not helping another team win games for peanuts.
fo48yfw	1587500240	Patriots	nfl	I dont like 2020.
fo48yir	1587500241	Rams	nfl	But Brady isnt in your long term future. So you need to get him the best team you can right now. And that is Gronk instead of Howard. Even without playing for a while. Who cares if OJ was the 17th pick? Why was everyone else on the offense producing better? Even Brate put up similar numbers. Just because he was a 1st round pick, doesnt mean thats what hes worth anymore.
fo48ytm	1587500245	Patriots	team	more like oj for gronk and picks, and itd still be a good deal
fo48z3w	1587500249	Jaguars	nfl	Upvotes can cure the coronavirus but BILL GATES and ANTHONY FAUCI wouldnt want you to know that because theyre the DEVIL!!!
fo48zaq	1587500251	Buccaneers	team	Can you imagine, Brady  Gronk! And then the season gets cancelled and neither ever suit up for Tampa...
fo48yyp	1587500247	Seahawks	nfl	GRONK SPIKE BALL AND CANNON GO BOOMTHEN GRONK GO FUCK COEDS FROM FSU.
fo48zc6	1587500252	Cardinals	nfl	No idea lmao. Anyone who watched Bucs games knows that Jameis is not close to the most inaccurate QB. In fact, he would fit it into tight spaces all the time. He just makes stupid mistakes and decisions. His arm is not his problem
fo48ysr	1587500244	Raiders	team	I dont think We have enough to offer to move up to 4.
fo48yuo	1587500245	Raiders	nfl	Now why the fuck would Tampa bay do that
fo48yvk	1587500245	Cowboys	team	Its not meaningless. Arguably, you could say that it means more than championships. Ideally, the Patriots would be far and away the most valuable franchise at this point. With 6 championships all won in the last 20 years and with the same coach and QB. But they arent.
fo48yyz	1587500247	Eagles	nfl	Have you considered his value now that hes the WWE 247 Champion? So much leverage there.
fo48z3h	1587500248	Steelers	team	WHICH WOULD BE THE SMART THING TO DO INSTEAD OF REACHING TO FILL A NEED....Better?
fo48z4j	1587500249	Patriots	nfl	Ill Yatesify this tweetPeople who should be freed1.OJ Howard.
fo48z61	1587500249	Falcons	team	I kept thinking they would grow on me, but everyday I like them even less. Some of those Chargers combos are legit, though, especially the powder blue and white.For the record, I tolerated the old Falcons Unis, but didnt particularly like them either.
fo48zbb	1587500251	Patriots	nfl	I wouldnt sweat it. As much I love Brady and Gronk, Gronk last year was subpar compared to the rest and same could be said for Brady. Saints are significantly better imo.
fo48zk9	1587500254	49ers	nfl	All Im saying is put JG in the 80s with the same lifestyle he has now, hed be a dominant receiver and no one would be talking about his drugs
fo48zav	1587500251	Bears	nfl	
fo48zg3	1587500253	Lions	team	Sign Everson Griffen, extend Golladay, maybe a veteran RB?Another option would be trading for one of the many veteran players on the block.
fo48zt9	1587500258	Patriots	team	Damn. That fast
fo48zhc	1587500253	Ravens	nfl	Then Gronk could sit on your roster like a tumor, sucking away 10 mil in cap while you only have 1 mil available. Again, no leverage
fo48zl6	1587500255	Cardinals	nfl	Yep. There are a lot of bad decisions about Madden on EAs part, but also many by the NFL as well. Part of the agreement in the deal is NFL gets to have a say on what goes into the game
fo48zxx	1587500259	Buccaneers	nfl	We also dont need him. He would be a luxury.
fo48zkd	1587500254	Buccaneers	nfl	I mean, its obvious any trade for gronk would include OJ.
fo48zmm	1587500255	49ers	nfl	This reminds me of when Marshawn signed with the Seahawks towards the end of last season.The hype was extreme but it was like 98 sentimental.
fo48zou	1587500256	Patriots	team	Edelman isnt a rat, hes not going to complain about playing for the team that helped him become one of the best rags to riches stories in the history of the league. They might do him a solid and send him but it wont be because hes bitching about it.l
fo48zp0	1587500256	Eagles	team	Disregard the crime. Its a big city. Gotta remember these players are fresh out of college and probably havent traveled much. Most of what they go through will be scary. Not tearing down Philly.. I love Philly. Ive been jumped in the city and replaced a bunch of car windows, nbd. Even though I moved, I will forever love Philly.
fo48zyf	1587500259	Vikings	team	If the joke is look at my shitty random unrealistic mock draft he nailed it.
fo4907z	1587500263	Broncos	nfl	They fuckin
fo490e9	1587500266	Patriots	team	If theyre also trading thuney, they should get more than that.
fo490p4	1587500270	Patriots	team	Fuck that timeline.
fo4904u	1587500262	Patriots	nfl	Please be 14 and a 5th for 23 and gronk
fo4906f	1587500263	Vikings	nfl	hell fit right on the chicago tight ends
fo490nd	1587500269	Steelers	team	Man, your instant reaction was way more elegant than my panel van and chloroform one.
fo490b0	1587500264	Browns	team	How high dyou reckon itll go?
fo490eu	1587500266	Steelers	nfl	If Gronk goes to Tampa, AB could be our only hope to ruin that team
fo490hn	1587500267	Vikings	team	Id start at 3 1st rounders for Nelson because we arent trading him
fo490i8	1587500267	Dolphins	nfl	Tampa needs a tackle way too much for this to happen.
fo490su	1587500271	Saints	team	4 months is a lot of time to get back into shape lol
fo490vi	1587500272	Steelers	team	Because I knew they played more than 41 games against teams with a losing record since 2012. Theres 128 games in 8 seasons after all. I already explained why Tomlin is an at best mediocre coach. Im not going to do it again.
fo4911f	1587500274	Patriots	team	Yes, no mono as said in the article.  Its bad even college but just looks wrong.
fo490g3	1587500266	Broncos	team	Not sure if youre serious.I would probably shit bricks if I found out I was actually talking to Talib, so dont play with my emotions.
fo490vq	1587500272	Jaguars	nfl	I think the joke is that this aged poorly because the original hashtag was for him to leave a bad team to go to the Pats.      Monkey paw curled hard
fo490tm	1587500272	Jets	team	Didnt Todd Marinovich have potential? Take the guy who knows what to do NOW, not maybe down the road.
fo4910h	1587500274	Redskins	nfl	yeah has anyone seen pics of the man lately? unless they push the season because of COVID, hows this man gonna put on 4050 pounds and get back into playing shape?
fo4911a	1587500274	Patriots	team	.....Brady, Evans, Goodwin, Gronk, Brate. Damn good chance of being a winning team.
fo4918p	1587500277	Eagles	nfl	Gronks about to evolve into the ultimate Florida Man.
fo491cu	1587500279	Panthers	nfl	Were tanking though. The Bucs have my full blessing to win the division over the Saints.
fo491e4	1587500279	Cowboys	nfl	Replied to the wrong comment. Disliking him playing well enough to oust the better qb that gave us a better chance for 2016 makes total sense.
fo491e8	1587500279	Eagles	team	No thank you.
fo491an	1587500278	Packers	team	In what was a deeper TE draft. There was a report a while back that stated Sternberger would have been the top TE in this draft.
fo491cs	1587500279	Patriots	team	I want off 2020
fo491ge	1587500280	Patriots	team	Ah yeah that makes sense. Maybe Bill gave them the go ahead on a physical while they ironed out a deal
fo491h3	1587500280	Bears	nfl	We discussed this in the subreddit a little while back, and when you look at stats like yards, receptions, catch , TDs, and a couple other stats, our best receivers of all time are Walter Payton, Matt Forte, and Brandon Marshall. Two of our all time best wide receivers are running backs lol.
fo491gg	1587500280	Patriots	team	Thanks Mambaout420, Lol hes FAR more important than youll ever be so he can do what he wants. Or are you just bitter he spent the last 20 years raping your team? Your opinion really holds a ton of weight to me.
fo491jr	1587500281	Broncos	nfl	My Uncle Denny has got one just like it.
fo491sm	1587500284	Patriots	nfl	If you think its worth us giving him up for a 5th or 6th your overestimating the value of a 5th or 6th. It would be incredibly stupid for us to give up Gronk for basically nothing when we desparately need a TE. It would be worth more for us to sit on it and see if we can get him to unretire for us than get a 6th, that is ridiculous
fo491xp	1587500286	Cardinals	nfl	bruce arians went from oj howard and jameis winston to tom brady and a faded gronk
fo491yv	1587500287	Dolphins	nfl	Its like the Bucs have stumbled on the same cheat code the Pats have been using for years.
fo491sv	1587500284	49ers	team	Williams is about to be a FA, we can possibly resign him, but it wouldnt be a bad idea getting a guy like Amrik to replace him.One of the most memorable moments is when he went up against a 66 wide out during the Texas game and made Texas look foolish for trying to exploit him.
fo491wg	1587500286	Chiefs	nfl	This is a very win win situation
fo491yz	1587500287	49ers	nfl	Hold on a second here. If hes coming back to the NFL, does that mean hes gonna bring the 247 title with him?
fo492ci	1587500292	Patriots	team	Didnt make you wait 24 hours this time.
fo4920z	1587500288	Eagles	team	God I hope not. Picking him would feel like drafting Agholor all over again.
fo49217	1587500288	Packers	nfl	Yup. Im not saying I know it all, but we as humans love believing that the deeper you go, the more true it must be. We just confirmed that an active US president is colluding with Russia tospoiler alertweaken and divide our country for their personal gain. We have a legit confirmed batshit theory, and their new conspiracy is that things are  normal lol
fo49222	1587500288	Browns	nfl	The Browns only 4k passing yard season is from 1980!
fo492ax	1587500291	Patriots	nfl	Is he allowed to take a physical with the Bucs?
fo4928c	1587500290	Patriots	team	Throw in Howard and Ill take it
fo492sr	1587500298	Patriots	team	I say ask for a kings ransom or leave him retired. Im salty over this.
fo492fi	1587500293	Buccaneers	team	Yeah this is the best possible business move for the bucs. Gronk and Brady  Mike Evans and Godwin? Thats a sold out stadium.
fo492km	1587500295	Patriots	team	Why isnt this even remotely surprising to me
fo492pm	1587500297	Colts	team	Could NE just trade Gronk for OJ Howard straight up?
fo492qh	1587500297	49ers	nfl	Thats honestly not bad for New England...
fo492ty	1587500299	Cowboys	nfl	That offense is unfair
fo492z9	1587500301	Buccaneers	nfl	2. Gronks rights
fo492z2	1587500301	49ers	nfl	 Lil V was having a terrible horrible no good very bad dayLil V is a mood. All day, erryday
fo4931w	1587500302	Patriots	nfl	I think BB wants to keep a few vets around to help teach the new team. Edelman seems too important for that.
fo492qb	1587500297	Texans	nfl	Fuck
fo492xz	1587500300	Lions	team	Cool bruh.
fo4932o	1587500302	Lions	team	Because someone else would trade up with the Lions to jump Miami. This happens all the time for QBs. The bears traded up 1 spot for their QB. Its preventative.
fo4938j	1587500304	Giants	nfl	The trade is Gronkowski  7th for Tampas 4thTold you he isnt worth much
fo493fy	1587500307	Vikings	nfl	Hernandez coming to the bucs too
fo49301	1587500301	Bears	nfl	Heh and you all call Jimmy Graham washed. Facts dont care about your feelings, Pace wins again
fo493ax	1587500305	Chiefs	nfl	We memed it into reality boys
fo493ef	1587500306	Broncos	nfl	THERE IT IS THIS IS IT
fo493ek	1587500306	Lions	team	This is the way
fo493i3	1587500308	Patriots	nfl	Booooooo
fo493mz	1587500310	Raiders	nfl	ADAM BOMB
fo493a1	1587500305	Lions	nfl	Nope
fo493j0	1587500308	Buccaneers	team	Up in Mons Venus doing the shmoney dance. I graduated from USF in the wrong decade.
fo493tv	1587500312	Panthers	nfl	I dont know how I spent several years subscribed to default subs
fo493jj	1587500308	Browns	nfl	Is there a love triangle between Gronk, Brady, and Bradys son?
fo493yp	1587500314	Bengals	nfl	Well, shit, that was fast
fo493q2	1587500311	Buccaneers	nfl	Lmao is all I have to say
fo493r0	1587500311	Patriots	nfl	ARE YOU EFFING KIDDING ME
fo493yw	1587500314	Patriots	nfl	Why would we be mad?  Well probably get a free fifth (maybe sixth) rounder, or nothing will change.  Id be excited for that, and after everything Brady and Gronk did for the franchise, I wish them both success in everything they do  if that means they win a title together in Tampa while NEs in a presumable rebuild year and unlikely to compete for a championship, good on them.  Both deserve it.
fo4941s	1587500315	Patriots	nfl	Gronk on offense at anything close to the end of 2018 would solve so many problems for them that they would cut guys to make it work. His addition on offense is that big
fo4947p	1587500317	Broncos	nfl	It doesnt look like anyone else has mentioned this, at all, because it would be silly to reply to this the same way as 12 other people already have  but its a swap of firsts. Thought you should know, since no one else pointed it out.
fo4949m	1587500318	Patriots	team	It in fact is what puts it on top for me, but obviously this year hasnt been great for the whole world now innit
fo494bb	1587500319	Giants	team	We drafted 3 last year and paid big money for Bradberry. I dont doubt the talent it would just be a reckless inefficient way to build a team investing that much in one place with so many other HUGE holes on the team
fo493to	1587500312	Patriots	team	fuck this
fo493x3	1587500313	Packers	nfl	Then I doubt they want to add an expensive 3 in the first place.
fo4946m	1587500317	Bears	nfl	Idk Gronk is injury prone, older, and probably less athletic at this point than OJ Howard. I wouldnt be that worried about this at all if I was a Saints fan
fo4946z	1587500317	Packers	nfl	THE NFC SOUTH JUST GOT INTERESTING AS FUCK
fo4948l	1587500318	Buccaneers	nfl	LOL..then they get nothing, no Gronk, no pick or player. I dont you guys know what leverage actually is.
fo494a4	1587500318	Falcons	team	and now add GRONK w e r fucked
fo494bo	1587500319	Steelers	nfl	At least hes in NFC now
fo49415	1587500315	Steelers	nfl	What the hell
fo4944y	1587500316	Vikings	nfl	Bill OBrien has entered the chat
fo4947h	1587500317	Patriots	team	Looks like this confirms what Rappaport and Schefter reported.Would sting a bit seeing both Brady and Gronkowski in another uniform, but Bill was prepared to trade Gronk to the Lions a couple of seasons back.
fo494he	1587500321	Raiders	nfl	ADAM BOMB
fo494ka	1587500322	Browns	nfl	 Dont know how the NFL gets around the social distancing aspect, though.I mean its an empty stadium. Put some stairs in, expand the sidelines to include a couple rows of bleachers?
fo494pa	1587500324	Bills	nfl	I hate the Cowboys, but this guy was perpetually underrated. So many fans, including Cowboys fans, painted him as a guy whod get great stats, but would choke under pressure. The truth was that they always had an overrated defense that was usually responsible for their loses.
fo494po	1587500324	Broncos	nfl	The Bucs have Mike Evans, Godwin, and now Gronk for Brady to throw to.
fo494r9	1587500325	Buccaneers	nfl	People in the other thread were really overestimating Gronks current value.
fo4955h	1587500330	Eagles	nfl	Gronk is evolving!Gronk has become FLORIDA MAN.

fo494oe	1587500324	Eagles	nfl	Thats way too much. Seems pretty obvious gronk doesnt wanna play for the pats. Howard and a fifth
fo494om	1587500324	Bengals	team	They need to go for a modernized version of the 8196 uniforms.  Most, but not least, get rid of the dumb, cartoony number font.
fo494wc	1587500327	Buccaneers	team	Gronk is clutch. Even when hes hurt he gets shit done. He is a beast. AND Tom trusts him... Thats worth a lot.
fo4951k	1587500329	Rams	nfl	 Nice
fo4958u	1587500331	Patriots	nfl	Wow...
fo495bn	1587500333	Browns	nfl	What the fuck man. Prime time incoming for the Bucs
fo495cv	1587500333	Steelers	nfl	Fourth for a guy who hasnt played football in a year is super solid
fo495eq	1587500334	Ravens	nfl	Lol what happened to that swap first lmao.
fo4954m	1587500330	Colts	nfl	WHO CANT HE THROW TO?
fo4956c	1587500330	Giants	nfl	Pats fans thought they were getting Howard lol
fo49578	1587500331	Patriots	team	Fade me
fo4957i	1587500331	Patriots	team	He can, but the player has to agree to those terms. So it would have to be a very favorable deal for the player. Would BB be willing to do that just to hold up a Gronk deal?
fo495eu	1587500334	Cowboys	nfl	hey (
fo495sp	1587500339	Patriots	team	 Gronk alone is worth OJa 2ndAre you pretending? We will be lucky to get a 3rd for a retired player that wont play for us lmao
fo495ue	1587500340	Falcons	team	That an injury prone TE who hasnt played in forever is going to play with a 40 plus year old QB?
fo495wi	1587500341	Jaguars	nfl	LEROYYYYY
fo4958w	1587500331	Patriots	team	A fourth for gronk and a 7th??
fo495am	1587500332	Panthers	team	and its a done deal, according to ESPN.
fo495c4	1587500333	Seahawks	nfl	The fact that theyre getting something for a player that wont play with them is fantastic.
fo495cw	1587500333	Jets	team	The next season will be the Ghostbusterseason
fo495dq	1587500333	Patriots	nfl	Yeah I dont know what the cap hit is or anything, but it might be mutually beneficial to trade him
fo495j9	1587500336	Buccaneers	team	The Tampa Bay Patriots!
fo495m5	1587500337	Patriots	nfl	Bruce Arians wouldnt let him have the shot to do so
fo495n2	1587500337	Eagles	team	I think Id cheer more for Nick Foles in an opposing uniform than I would for any other Eagle. The guy is a legend.
fo495wz	1587500341	Eagles	team	Dallas just got almost five million more reasons to give Dak the extension he doesnt deserve and will never earn.
fo4961q	1587500343	Patriots	nfl	Skip out on the top 4, shoot for Josh Jones from Houston at 23.    You now have Gronk and OJ Howard flanking your OTs.
fo495ql	1587500339	Seahawks	team	Yeah I think theyre a bit plain but totally fine and definitely an upgrade over the old ones. Theres some fuss about the stripes apparently, but it looks fine to me.  I think maybe having a bunch of teams unveiling new unis at the same time is making people compare and contrast them, which makes the Pats one look not very exciting.
fo495tr	1587500340	Patriots	team	Lmao a 7th and gronk for a 4th you are delusional
fo4965f	1587500345	Bears	nfl	Buccaneers got their booty
fo496ar	1587500346	Buccaneers	team	Gronk for Jameis straight up? Lol
fo496dd	1587500348	Seahawks	nfl	rfantasyfootball absolutely scrambling
fo496es	1587500348	Patriots	nfl	Panthers are supposed to be good this year?
fo495xc	1587500341	Buccaneers	nfl	The No Fly Zone that was the worst pass defense that year
fo4960t	1587500342	Cowboys	nfl	Nice
fo496c5	1587500347	Jaguars	nfl	Wtf Pats got fleeced
fo496fd	1587500348	Packers	team	That place is such a shithole. And its not even that old! Ive been to stadiums twice its age that are in better shape and have more amenities. Hell, Baltimore at least has light rail getting to MT!
fo496ji	1587500350	Patriots	team	Fuck, just a 4th?????
fo496mq	1587500351	Titans	nfl	Theres also one that says correlation does not equal causation.
fo496oj	1587500352	Falcons	nfl	Well. Saints vs Buccs games are gonna be fucking amazing!
fo4965v	1587500345	Patriots	nfl	Tua szn
fo496lh	1587500351	Saints	team	Its done Gronk  7th got Bucs 4th rounder
fo496ms	1587500351	Patriots	nfl	Yeah that doesnt mean NE doesnt have leverage, which is all i was disagreeing with. This trade would be a ridiculous overpay though, no clue why Tampa would want him at this price unless theyre just all in on appeasing tb12
fo496ir	1587500350	Patriots	team	Hes already taken a physical
fo496m8	1587500351	Packers	nfl	Fuck me sideways
fo496og	1587500352	Patriots	team	ARE YOU EFFING KIDDING ME
fo496t8	1587500354	Lions	team	Is there any Limo drivers with inside info?
fo496wt	1587500355	Patriots	team	youre kidding me
fo496wz	1587500355	Bengals	team	I really like Queen, I know hes kinda small but hes pretty versatile and quick which I like. If not I hope we can snag Willie Gay or ADG in the third
fo496yf	1587500356	Ravens	nfl	What happened to that first swap?
fo4972u	1587500358	Patriots	team	This isnt even remotely shocking. You knew that if Gronk was going anywhere, it would be where Brady is
fo496qm	1587500353	Patriots	team	WE GOT ROBBED. PUN INTENDED
fo496vi	1587500355	Bears	nfl	A number 2 offense no less.That was the year Lance Briggs was falling asleep I team meetings and ditching practice to run his BBQ restaurants...
fo49735	1587500358	Eagles	team	I hope we get him so I can get my brother his jersey.
fo496xh	1587500355	Buccaneers	nfl	Patriots fans smoking thinking they were getting a 2nd rounder.
fo4971x	1587500357	Buccaneers	nfl	DUDE IM IN LOVE WITH LIFE. WHO WANTS TO SMOKE A BLUNT.
fo4979y	1587500360	Buccaneers	nfl	Okay then you can keep him for that. But his actual value is a fifth or a six. He certainly isnt worth OJ Howard lol.
fo497f7	1587500362	Giants	nfl	Its a free trade up from 7th to 4th. Its like finding a twenty in your old pants
fo497py	1587500366	Broncos	team	I would probably shit bricks if I found out I was actually talking to Talib, so dont play with my emotions.
fo497da	1587500361	Seahawks	nfl	A 4th? Thats great for the Patriots.
fo497fs	1587500362	Patriots	nfl	Gronk doing us one last big solid, pls
fo497oe	1587500366	Bengals	nfl	tide pod man is BACK
fo497ui	1587500368	Buccaneers	team	OMG WTF
fo497g0	1587500362	Chiefs	nfl	WTF is going on how did this all happen so fast
fo497qt	1587500366	Buccaneers	team	Omg congrats
fo497qx	1587500367	Chiefs	nfl	So either Hoodie didnt want OJ as compensation or the Bucs think theyll get better for a 4th for him. Considering the Patriots options at TE...
fo497zc	1587500370	Patriots	nfl	Pats could easily trade Thuney and open up 14 mil. Assuming Belichick never has leverage in a situation like this is a mistake.
fo497ps	1587500366	Chargers	nfl	Aw snap, here we go again.
fo497wb	1587500369	Patriots	team	Im sort of with you. Ask for the moon and dont move him unless they overpay. 1st and Howard sounds like a good starting point to me.
fo497z1	1587500370	Colts	nfl	I could see a swap OJ for Gronk and like a later pick on either side
fo4983n	1587500371	Vikings	team	I would love another second so we dont reach for a wr with the depth in this draft
fo49865	1587500372	Seahawks	team	And again on top of that I dont consider this empirical data to be valid. There are too many variables that it cant measure, and there is no control group.
fo498ff	1587500376	Buccaneers	team	THATS IT?!
fo498ie	1587500377	Steelers	nfl	I think 05 is really its only competition
fo498jg	1587500377	Seahawks	nfl	I heard Robert Kraft gave him some recommendations  couple of places hes just bursting with excitement to check out
fo497wp	1587500369	Broncos	nfl	I think the Bucs can live with that. This is a cherry atop the sundae, this is not the sundae.
fo497xf	1587500369	Rams	nfl	LEROY CALLED IT
fo4982t	1587500371	Falcons	nfl	NFC South come together!
fo49838	1587500371	Dolphins	team	Lol his footwork is one of his best traits.
fo4983q	1587500372	Browns	nfl	honestly great return for New England!
fo4985d	1587500372	Bills	nfl	Pirates of The Carribean Theme Intensifies
fo4988l	1587500373	Cowboys	nfl	Nice. Tompa Bay is going to be really fun
fo498am	1587500374	Ravens	nfl	DJ was just a little off
fo498f6	1587500376	Packers	team	I would love to see a sweet new color rush (I do love the all white dont get me wrong) or throwback jersey though. Sounds like well get that next year instead
fo498g8	1587500376	Dolphins	team	Pick 1.5 (J Herbert, QB)  Pick 1.18 (A Thomas , OT)  Pick 1.26 (X Mckinney, S)  Pick 2.39 (J Dobbins, RB)  Pick 2.56 (A Jackson , OT)  Pick 3.70 (J Madubuike, DT )  Bonus questions  Do we Pick at 5? (yes)  1.5 trades by the dolphins in these picks (Over)Which Power 5 Conference will we Select More Players From (SEC)
fo498hw	1587500377	Buccaneers	nfl	Our comp 4th or early 4th? At the end of the day not a huge difference, but the comp 4th would be more ideal.
fo498mu	1587500378	Bears	nfl	RONPAULITSHAPPENING.GIF
fo498oq	1587500379	Patriots	nfl	Its really good for a guy they didnt expect to get anything for. Thanks Gronk!
fo4987d	1587500373	49ers	nfl	Where Tampa and Atlanta left me disappointed with their uniforms, the Chargers really nailed it. I prefer the number font of the 0719 jerseys, and like the navy face mask better, but the numbers on the helmet and the gold alternative pants are dope. Good call back to the Air Coryell era. I might be a 9ers fan, but damn that powder blue 
fo4987h	1587500373	Packers	nfl	A dog twitter account got this weeks before anyoneThis fuckin league man lol
fo498ik	1587500377	Chiefs	nfl	Getting embarrassed in the playoffs by the Titans is a requirement. Trust the process.
fo498t6	1587500381	Vikings	team	Jerry Didnt Fumble, Oswald acted alone, and Pluto is a planet.
fo498mr	1587500378	Ravens	nfl	Id rather have OJ Howard than whats left of Rob Gronkowski.
fo498qo	1587500380	Patriots	nfl	Holy shit... anyway I can get a Buccaneers Bandwagon flair this early on??
fo498ro	1587500380	Vikings	team	Im guessing you never gave birth... or were around someone giving birth other than your mother... She would have been pissed no matter what  you adopt and get over it and realize it was the stress and pain of birth.
fo498vm	1587500382	Bills	nfl	A 4th round pick is more than Id expect for a guy who wasnt playing football, did you think I expected him to be dealt for a second or 3rd?
fo498x2	1587500382	Giants	nfl	Considering the fact that they all thought Howard was going to be part of the trade, its pretty bad.
fo498xd	1587500383	Steelers	nfl	I 100 think they pass on Herbert for an OT. With Newton, Jameis, and Dalton available I dont think a win now roster takes a QB like Herbert. I think the mocks are completely off report is going to be valid here.
fo498zt	1587500383	Bears	nfl	But they dont have to trade him either. If they dont trade him he stays retired and they retain his rights.
fo4990i	1587500384	Colts	nfl	Yes. Hopefully your team gets fleeced.
fo4991v	1587500384	Falcons	team	For a 7th at that. Unfuckingbelievable
fo49955	1587500385	Falcons	nfl	Fuck the NFC South I guess
fo4998o	1587500387	Patriots	nfl	Getting a 4th for someone who was not going to contribute for you is very solid given the circumstances. Obviously itll suck for fans to see Gronk on another team but at least its with Brady. Im cool with it.
fo499au	1587500387	Panthers	nfl	All Presidents do this
fo499cg	1587500388	Patriots	team	Gronk isnt worth OJ plus a 2nd at this point, but should return a 3rd on his own, purely based on Brady demand and namesake.
fo499f5	1587500389	Panthers	nfl	Throw in a bag a weed and you got yourself a deal
fo498qn	1587500380	Redskins	team	Yeah I dont see this as anything more than them doing due intelligence. Im sure the Bengals have listened to calls, eventhough theres like a 99.99999 chance that theyve had their minds made up for months and arent moving out of 1. And the Skins options are limited. Really the only team worth trading back with is the Dolphins. Because of their draft capital, and their current draft location. I dont see the Skins going past 5.   The Chargers at 6 maybe could happen if they pull some RG3 type offer, but I dont see that happening. Theyd get their QB, but then theyd be crippled when it comes to 1st round picks for the next 23 years.
fo498s7	1587500380	Saints	nfl	FUCK
fo498u8	1587500381	Patriots	team	Id tell Gronk to kick rocks if this was the best offer they got
fo498uu	1587500382	Falcons	team	Toughest division in football
fo498xv	1587500383	Browns	nfl	Yeah this makes much more sense than the swapping first trade idea.
fo498z8	1587500383	Cowboys	team	Welp
fo498z7	1587500383	Colts	nfl	Everybody get in here!
fo49902	1587500383	Buccaneers	team	Fucking lol
fo49947	1587500385	Patriots	team	HAHAHHAHA FUCK THIS SHIT
fo4995l	1587500385	Chiefs	nfl	Bucs got their guy.
fo4999i	1587500387	Buccaneers	nfl	I literally just said this to my cousin word for word. But Im not sure how I feel with this tight end room getting so crowded. I dont think Ill like when we get rid of the odd man out.
fo49994	1587500387	Vikings	team	LOL. not 1, not 2, not 3 but 4 QBs
fo499a4	1587500387	Eagles	team	Boo?  Fuck you.
fo499af	1587500387	Patriots	team	Lol uhhhhhhh about that
fo499hr	1587500390	Patriots	team	Meh, not a great return. But for a retired player who we cant even afford anyway, Ill take it.
fo499hq	1587500390	Eagles	team	Hooker would be more of a Rodney McLeod replacement. Id much rather have a player like Hooker, FS that can make plays on the ball. But I dont think Howie would give up anything significant to replace a guy they just resigned at this point. Especially because Hooker will want a good contract soon and next years cap is an issue.

fo499sj	1587500394	Buccaneers	team	Thats what Im saying dude. Fuck it give Bill all the cutoff hoodies in Florida if he wants em
fo499yt	1587500397	Patriots	nfl	Problem was always injury. Hey had over a year to get healthy.
fo49a4o	1587500399	Texans	nfl	I wonder if people are gonna call this what it is, pretty douchy move by Gronk.
fo499m6	1587500392	Bengals	nfl	2020 is a very strange timeline
fo499o5	1587500393	Bears	team	I like the idea of taking take as a UDFa7th.I think at the very least we could put him in the LJ2018 type offense if we get the run game right. And honesty for a 7th rounder, thats a good value to get as a cheap backup.
fo499vk	1587500395	Saints	nfl	Nice. I hope they feel good on your chopped asshole
fo499y1	1587500396	Vikings	team	This is the way of Spielman. Early March Vikings interested in moving up for Lamb (Local source).Three days later Vikings wont address WR until round three (National source).Mid April Vikings looking at round 1 WR (National source).Two days later We can find them in rounds 4 or 5.
fo49a16	1587500397	Eagles	nfl	The NFC south is going to be so much fun next year. The bucs are going to be awesome to play in madden
fo49a1f	1587500397	Rams	team	Id take Chris Long over Fowler as well
fo49a35	1587500398	Colts	nfl	The comments will go so fast nobody will notice im gay
fo49ac1	1587500401	Eagles	nfl	Get that shit outtaaaa heeeerrreee
fo499s3	1587500394	Patriots	team	Doesnt TB need a guard? I wonder if something like Gronk, Thuney, 23 for Howard, 14, and 76 could work
fo499zz	1587500397	Lions	team	Andrew Thomas is a fucking stud and that would be a smart move by the Dolphins.
fo49a8c	1587500400	Giants	nfl	April fools was 20 days ago...right?
fo49a27	1587500398	Cowboys	team	Just paid Jarwin and if were going to double down on offense it needs to be another receiver
fo49a58	1587500399	Patriots	nfl	What fucking year is it?
fo49abk	1587500401	Patriots	team	Fuck off
fo49am8	1587500405	49ers	nfl	The New Englander New reparhts indicate that Rawb Grawnkowski wants to join tha Tawmpa Bay Buccaneehs to play with that cheatin slut, Tawm Brady. This would undoubtedly break tha hawts of millions of New England fans and our scientists conclude that this would result in a mass suicide of 100 million people in Massachusetts. This is wicked bad when you considah that theres only about 6.8 people in Massachusetts.
fo49a20	1587500398	Eagles	nfl	But does he have the Rona? STAY TUNED
fo49a42	1587500398	Patriots	nfl	I mean, we didnt have gronk last year, werent planning on having him this year so I dont see that as being a loss 
fo49aew	1587500402	Patriots	team	Bill be like.. 4th rounder for nothing? 
fo49afp	1587500402	Patriots	nfl	I SWEAR TO GOD
fo49agi	1587500403	Patriots	team	Hes already not a PatriotOut of NFL shape (assumption)Made of glass thats been broken, glued back together, broken again, and glued back together yet againI love Gronk and am extremely great full for everything hes done for the team. But its time to move on whether he stays retired or comes back to the NFL on another team.
fo49ake	1587500404	Bears	nfl	Honestly looks like a really good trade for both sides
fo49al8	1587500405	Lions	team	I believe we can cut JJ after this season, or maybe get a 6th or 7th for him
fo49ao5	1587500406	Raiders	nfl	Sorry with that contract ice cubes are a deal breaker
fo49ax2	1587500409	Patriots	team	Maybe, but it could also be a top receiver, or a top LB, hell maybe Simmons does fall (though unlikely, but think Derwin James) because hes somewhat position less or theres a run on tackles. And TE is one of our biggest needs and Id rather give up 23 and Gronk to move up since OJ is far and away better than any of the tight ends in this class
fo49b2e	1587500411	Panthers	team	What are you serious?
fo49ae9	1587500402	Buccaneers	nfl	I really wish we couldve stuck with OJ long term, but hopefully well at least get something nice for him.
fo49ah8	1587500403	Buccaneers	nfl	Lol honestly I wouldnt have even minded losing OJ but this is fine
fo49ahn	1587500403	Lions	team	So what youre saying is that were getting Brady
fo49aos	1587500406	Bears	nfl	If Im not wrong Johnny Morris never had a 1000 yard season. He just had like 12 mediocre seasons
fo49arc	1587500407	Buccaneers	team	Wow! Couldnt ask for better really.
fo49aud	1587500408	Falcons	nfl	The Bucs get Gronk and keep OJ, oh fuck me
fo49awq	1587500409	Seahawks	nfl	Ok ya but at worst hes a top 10 TE tho.
fo49aq0	1587500406	Buccaneers	team	LMAO, you guys really got Gronk for a 4th round pick just now huh?
fo49avf	1587500408	Patriots	team	OJ Howard is a bust. You dont just magically turn into a beast after being a disappointment. His numbers have been going down. Yeah, I know we dont have any TE but we really just need to start from scratch  a mismatch.
fo49avr	1587500408	Browns	nfl	The comp pick gods are getting picks for their retired players now.
fo49axl	1587500409	Ravens	nfl	What does that say about the 4th round pick you guys just got for the greatest tight end of all time?
fo49az8	1587500410	Broncos	nfl	Fucking hell lmao
fo49b0k	1587500410	Eagles	nfl	lmao damn the mods nearly killed me(httpsimgur.comayUm0D3q)
fo49b3v	1587500411	Jets	team	You can only trade down for a few more seconds and thirds if there is a team willing to trade up and give you a few more seconds and thirds
fo49bc7	1587500414	Bears	team	I like trading back a bit and getting Arnette.  Press corner to play opposite Fuller (who like offman).
fo49bcj	1587500414	Patriots	nfl	Free fourth round pick for a player we thought was done??
fo49bdf	1587500415	Broncos	team	I had better luck streaming from my phone to TV but there were still a couple episodes that were off even then.
fo49bf8	1587500415	Patriots	team	What the fuck man
fo49bhi	1587500416	Patriots	team	Good trade. Got a 4th for a guy that was gonna do nothing for us. More ammo to trade up with
fo49b07	1587500410	Patriots	team	Id do that trade 11 times out of 10, but no way were getting Howard and a pick for a retired Gronk, right?
fo49b30	1587500411	Patriots	team	Wish it was at least a 3rd but Ill take it
fo49b9r	1587500413	Patriots	team	Throw in Jules and Gilmore while were at it sigh.....
fo49bba	1587500414	Redskins	nfl	Yes, please
fo49bkl	1587500417	Patriots	team	Some one end me
fo49ba7	1587500413	Patriots	nfl	Theres a chance Tampa is terrible.And who doesnt enjoy cheering for the NFLs favorite Labrador retriever in human form?Ill still be a Pats fan through  through. But Ill also enjoy watching TB12 play his twilight years. Added bonus of Gronk maybe.
fo49bcu	1587500414	Eagles	nfl	Holy Buccing shit!!
fo49bfi	1587500415	Patriots	team	No OJ Howard???? Pain.
fo49bto	1587500420	Falcons	team	The Chargers uniforms look very good. Theyre a modernized take on a classic look. Also, they arent monochromatic. The Browns new uniforms also look very good, especially for their hardtoswallow color scheme. A big plus for them is that the new uniforms are a huge improvement over their old ones. Ours are different, but dont look objectively better than the previous. Do you know what one of the worst parts of the Browns old uniforms was? Giant text on the front. Guess what we chose to do? Giant text on the front. Plus, monochromatic uniforms. The white pants with black jerseys looks pretty good and I hope that ends up becoming what is usually worn at home. The white jerseys go well with either white or black pants. All our jerseys would also look much better with a smaller Atlanta on the front instead of the massive ATL. Combining what others have said, the Chargers listened to the fans and paid homage to the past with an updated look on classic uniforms. The Falcons tried to be bold and deviate from the norm which produced a createateam look that youd expect to see on a TV show.
fo49bl8	1587500417	Dolphins	nfl	Well...that was fast.
fo49byl	1587500422	Patriots	team	There is no cap hit to worry about
fo49c7o	1587500425	49ers	nfl	clapping intensifies
fo49cbs	1587500427	Dolphins	team	True words from the devils mouth.
fo49boh	1587500418	Panthers	nfl	Nah Gronk willed it by hinting at a return every other week since he retired.
fo49bqd	1587500419	Giants	nfl	Gronk  7th for Tampas 4thTold you he isnt worth much
fo49bru	1587500420	Raiders	nfl	They just need to draft a good receiving back to pair with Ronald Jones and that offense could be deadly.
fo49bwk	1587500421	Seahawks	nfl	YeahSo great
fo49c0q	1587500423	Patriots	team	f
fo49c53	1587500424	Vikings	nfl	That was fast. So does Gronk lose his belt?
fo49c7n	1587500425	Chargers	team	Love the combinations. I hope they do white socks when they rock the all white setup. How yall do feel about the yellow pants being worn with the navyroyal jerseys?
fo49cap	1587500426	Patriots	team	lol belichik is the worst gm in the league. no pro bowlers drafted in 7 years, traded a second round for sanu and ends up not even getting howard in this deal when he could easily have been had
fo49bzu	1587500422	Eagles	team	Ok fair enough
fo49cci	1587500427	Seahawks	nfl	Alright, finally decided to watch Community. Never seen a a single episode.
fo49cdr	1587500428	Patriots	team	HOLYSHIT
fo49cg1	1587500429	Bears	nfl	This would be a great trade for both sides, until now it seemed like Gronk was set on staying retired and even with him wanting to come back now its just to play with Brady, not the Pats. Some people are concerned if he can stay healthy but the Buccaneers already have a really solid group of TEs that could easily be starters if something were to happen to Gronk. Hes not coming back to the Pats so this is essentjally free capital for whatever they get for him and the Buccaneers get potentially one of the best TEs in the league who already has an extremely good and established connection with their starting QB.
fo49chj	1587500429	Bears	nfl	Probably unpopular opinion but I bet OJ Howard would be harder to cover than Gronk at this point in their careers and theres almost no chance Gronk stays healthy. He never does
fo49cmy	1587500431	Patriots	nfl	Because I dont want to spend a 1st on a QB when its going to take multiple years to rebuild our team and we have other spots that we 100 need to fill right now
fo49cn8	1587500431	Patriots	team	How much fucking value do you think Gronk had?Seriously?This isnt 2017 Gronk or 2014 Gronk lmao?
fo49cop	1587500432	Colts	nfl	I thought they would have traded Gronk for OJ Howard straight up.
fo49crd	1587500433	Patriots	team	Id take no less than a third
fo49d0d	1587500436	Patriots	nfl	Its like you found your exs wallet so you return it but they let you keep the cash. Win, win.
fo49d0r	1587500436	Patriots	team	Same. The GOAT leaves and the drama that goes with that, and now hes using it to lure another retired Patriot legend at this point to come back and ruin the amazing ending that he had, to go play with him for 2 years in Tampa fucking Bay. Come on. This is why I only go all in on teams and dont usually idolize players. Tom Brady was different so that one hurt but all these players dont give a shit, theyll turn their backs on your team and the fans in a second. If Brady and Gronk will do it, basically the 2 I wouldve thought for sure never in a million years are going anywhere else and will retire here, well then there really isnt any loyalty. At least its extremely rare. Not saying I dont still think Tom is the greatest ever, but as a Patriots fan this entire thing has soured my overall perception of him. I know he doesnt give a shit but it sucks.
fo49d20	1587500437	Buccaneers	team	Pats fans were talking about getting our first rounder. They really are spoiled.
fo49d7a	1587500439	Patriots	nfl	Why would Tom waste his time doing a PSA with the mayor? Like its just so far below him its an unimaginable proposition.
fo49d9m	1587500439	Dolphins	nfl	send him to the Cards!!!
fo49ch2	1587500429	Chargers	nfl	WOW
fo49cm3	1587500431	Patriots	team	What a lame return.
fo49cp8	1587500432	Saints	nfl	Just? You been paying attention?
fo49cq6	1587500432	Falcons	nfl	One of those will be against you guys.
fo49cxd	1587500435	Buccaneers	team	I dont know what to do with my hands
fo49cz1	1587500436	Buccaneers	team	Jay Glazer just tweeted he passed his physical.
fo49d4t	1587500438	Bears	team	Historically, the difference between a 1st and 2nd round QB is about the same as the difference between a 2nd and a 7th. If you cant take a QB in the first youre better off throwing multiple late round picks at the problem than spending a 2nd or a 3rd
fo49d72	1587500439	Vikings	nfl	I think a 3rd was the absolute highest. This is a good trade for both
fo49dbi	1587500440	Falcons	team	No way 
fo49dfp	1587500442	Panthers	nfl	that shits not happening lol youre not getting a 26 year old TE for a 1 year rental. yall are ridiculous.
fo49dj5	1587500443	Buccaneers	nfl	We havent gotten rid of Howard though. Hes still there along with Brate. Its a zero percent chance he plays for you though. So, you get nothing or you accept a 5th for a player that will do nothing for you. You take a 5th and youre happy about it as a Patriot.
fo49d2m	1587500437	Bears	nfl	yo holy shit
fo49dbu	1587500440	Patriots	team	I would have expected OJ Howard as well...wtf Bill.
fo49dep	1587500441	Lions	team	Ill give you one McChicken and a slice of cheesecake if you eat your show.
fo49dhw	1587500443	Patriots	team	really? What a fucking sham. Wont play for us but will go play in Tampa.
fo49dm8	1587500444	Buccaneers	nfl	Daddy hold me
fo49dnm	1587500445	Broncos	nfl	This aged well
fo49dnz	1587500445	Dolphins	nfl	Daniel Jones going to knock them out in the first round.That is destiny fulfilled
fo49dow	1587500445	Bears	nfl	big loss for WWE
fo49dqz	1587500446	Bears	team	Lamer Jackson fell to 31 in a world before Lamar jackson fell to 31.
fo49dse	1587500446	Steelers	nfl	Patriot fan friend said Gronk  Thuney for Howard  2nd.I told him now higher than a third and he said no way. Lol
fo49du4	1587500447	Vikings	team	I would believe this if Rick actually said 7th round instead of 4th or 5th.
fo49d9y	1587500440	Broncos	nfl	Swapping fourth and sevenths. Basically the same thing.
fo49dbp	1587500440	Eagles	nfl	The Pats always win.
fo49dbs	1587500440	Ravens	team	Thanks!, interesting take, but they are intended to be  Raven wings... (had to look up your reference... lol). Looking forward to rooting for them on the field soon.
fo49dc5	1587500440	Patriots	team	Trade is complete, we get a 4th for a 7th
fo49df0	1587500441	Patriots	team	How did he take a physical already?
fo49dn3	1587500445	Patriots	team	Only bill would take 4
fo49dp6	1587500445	Buccaneers	team	Its happening!
fo49drz	1587500446	Eagles	nfl	Licht is so awful god damn
fo49dxm	1587500448	Jets	team	Quinnen is pretty good. He did his job last year, a few missed games but came up big on run stopping downs. Give him some time.. you dont know someones potential until the end of his rookie contract
fo49dsr	1587500447	Raiders	nfl	httpstwitter.comAdamSchefterstatus1252693001450782721?s19Woooow
fo49e5f	1587500451	Patriots	nfl	This offseason is great!
fo49dvh	1587500448	Patriots	nfl	So what about AB
fo49ecp	1587500454	Dolphins	nfl	httpsyoutu.beCZDGbbexysU
fo49edt	1587500454	Patriots	team	Not getting a 2nd, everyone is delusional thinking they would get a high pick.
fo49ef6	1587500455	Jets	nfl	Bull fucking shit. Collusion and treason. Suspend Brady Belichick and Gronk.
fo49eic	1587500456	Patriots	nfl	Swap him and our pick for TB pick with Howard and we have ourselves a deal
fo49dss	1587500447	Jaguars	nfl	Fournette for OJ Howard who says no
fo49dvw	1587500448	Ravens	nfl	I dont think Rob Gronkowski is ready to dedicate his heart and soul to becoming a Buccaneer. I think he just wants to fuck around with his pal Tom for one more season then hang it up.
fo49e2y	1587500450	Browns	nfl	Why would the Bucs be interested in a worse tight end than they already have
fo49e68	1587500451	Falcons	nfl	I mean it was 2 minutes away from being announced at 420pm
fo49e9o	1587500453	Buccaneers	team	This is the one. I know I shouldnt say this in a stickied comment, but I have a boner. TOMPA BAY GRONKENEERS LETS FUCKIN GO!!!!
fo49edm	1587500454	Browns	nfl	How many tackles dont miss time with injuries?Joe Thomas.
fo49ep7	1587500459	Panthers	nfl	As a Panthers fan, this is probably bad for me. As a wrestling fan, I wont miss him. Mojo Rawley must be sweating right now though
fo49e3c	1587500450	Redskins	nfl	Khomeini died 30 years ago
fo49e4x	1587500451	Saints	team	One out of fifteen 1st round picks. And he sucked.
fo49ech	1587500454	Falcons	team	............shit
fo49ees	1587500455	Lions	nfl	Brady, Evans, Godwin, and Gronk. Were a Barry Sanders away from Madden Ultimate Team
fo49eht	1587500456	49ers	nfl	I predict his opponentsteammates will bring a Referee with them to take his 247 title.
fo49eoj	1587500458	Eagles	nfl	Effectively, they traded a seventh for a fourth. Great deal for the Pats.
fo49ex2	1587500462	Patriots	nfl	Edelman about to be the Squidward looking out the window meme
fo49f0e	1587500463	Buccaneers	nfl	And a top 3 blocking TE
fo49f67	1587500465	Buccaneers	team	Hes 30 with an injury history that already forced him to retire once. OJ is 25 with a lot of upside. Im fine bringing in Gronk but I dont want to do it if it means giving up OJ for not much.
fo49f6u	1587500466	Packers	nfl	Can someone explain why Gronk still has a 10m contract with the Pats even though he retired? Or is it just the fact that hes still contracted for that term but not being paid?
fo49f6w	1587500466	Buccaneers	nfl	And Brate who is lesser known but awesome, and could even possibly make OJ Howard decent. This is the best set of weapons Brady has ever had right? I dont really remember who played along side moss
fo49f7h	1587500466	Patriots	team	So sorry, and will feel even worse for you if Detroit goes with anyone not named Jeff Okudah in the first round. The need is so obvious and hes the best CB prospect in years
fo49f87	1587500466	Vikings	team	Its not if you pay attention to football.
fo49f92	1587500467	Patriots	team	wild how fast this is happening
fo49f0d	1587500463	Buccaneers	team	Schefter tweeting that Gronk and 7th for a 4th.Congratulations lol.
fo49f0k	1587500463	Patriots	nfl	Yeah but now that you guys are going to have 3 TEs, does Brate or OJ go?
fo49f19	1587500463	Titans	team	Wow, Jadaveon Clowney signed for cheap! He must really want to be here.
fo49f21	1587500464	Packers	nfl	itshappening.gif
fo49f2x	1587500464	Bears	team	Shaheen?  Naw man, thats a conditional 8th round pick.
fo49f86	1587500466	Buccaneers	team	Id be much happier if this was the comp 4th, but honestly prefer this to the Gronk  late pick for OJ talk that was floating around.
fo49fcp	1587500468	Browns	nfl	Funny, they remind me of Kent State. Mostly because of the colors, but also because the team logo looks like an eagle with a lightning bolt coming out of its neck. (httpsimages.app.goo.gluudUUpGLVC3y1WoV7)
fo49eyb	1587500462	Patriots	nfl	Lot of cap currently tied up in Thuney who is almost definitely getting moved this week
fo49f1j	1587500464	Seahawks	nfl	no joke my last high schoolfirst college GF emailed me the other day to reconnect like, huh. what was going through YOUR brain.
fo49f27	1587500464	Patriots	nfl	Yes but it wouldve been nice to have him play last year when we had no one to throw to
fo49f8r	1587500467	Titans	team	The Maryland alum in me would love if we grabbed Anthony McFarland.
fo49fjq	1587500471	Ravens	nfl	I think Brady, Evans, Godwin, OJ, and Gronk is already deadly.
fo49fc3	1587500468	Bears	nfl	Pleaseeeeee Mr Arians make this happen
fo49fqm	1587500473	Patriots	team	I think the shocking would be value but eh, he was not going to play anyways so well see how good he is in Tampa.
fo49fxb	1587500476	Jets	nfl	Because he cant play anymore
fo49fbr	1587500468	Texans	nfl	He also has only 14 in his last three seasons.
fo49fl3	1587500471	Patriots	nfl	I want off 2020
fo49fp1	1587500473	Buccaneers	team	Both teams did well. But god damn this season better happen.
fo49fpp	1587500473	Patriots	team	Gronk made a big deal about coming to terms with never playing again. His recent insta videos show him healthy but not at pro football TE weight.  I just dont believe it will happen because hes not physically ready.
fo49fsh	1587500474	Patriots	team	 OJ Howard is not a beast, at all. Dude has 1400 yards and 12 touchdowns in three seasons. Gronk eclipsed that production in his second season alone. No idea where this comes from that Howard is this great player when all evidence is to the contrary at the NFL level.
fo49fuv	1587500475	Cardinals	team	These are the best uniforms Ive seen that dont change the helmet color
fo49g13	1587500477	Chargers	team	They should give out free lightning bolts that light up to all fans in attendance. During a night game, the whole stadium lit up in yellow lightning bolts chanting in unison...
fo49g0l	1587500477	Buccaneers	team	Could definitely be worse. I guess now we just wait and see what we get for OJ.
fo49gch	1587500482	Buccaneers	nfl	Right. Nothing or Something. Which do you think an organization wants?
fo49ggh	1587500483	Bears	nfl	i mean howards worth as much as a 4th, it wasnt unreasonable
fo49gkn	1587500485	Buccaneers	team	Florida man is coming home!
fo49fyl	1587500477	Buccaneers	team	Brates better OJ been trash idk why
fo49g0z	1587500477	Patriots	team	I know it was said earlier he did but Schefter just tweeted out that the trade is pending the physical. Id go with Schefter on this one
fo49g26	1587500478	Patriots	team	God damn, the old fashion double whammy.Bucs offense is gonna be crazy next year.
fo49gbm	1587500481	Ravens	team	Yeah. Its been in a steady decline since 1314 imo. But 2K is making an arcade type football game this year. And madden iirc only controls the simulation football market for one or two more years. That being said, madden 21 or 22 should be much better in regards to franchise and overall gameplay so they dont lose simulation rights to 2k if their football franchise is successful.
fo49gnu	1587500486	Raiders	nfl	Swing and a miss.
fo49g42	1587500479	Bills	nfl	Emphasis on little
fo49gao	1587500481	Jets	nfl	Holy fucking shit the Bucs are absolutely LOADED
fo49gb3	1587500481	Steelers	team	Yeah  I can see that I should have phrased that differently.
fo49ggs	1587500483	Bills	nfl	Mr. Bucs Choice
fo49gin	1587500484	Saints	team	We got destroyed by healthy TEs in their prime. Im sorry I just dont see Gronk having the same impact.
fo49gkh	1587500485	Seahawks	nfl	i would die for little V
fo49gnd	1587500486	Bears	team	Mitchell Trubisky, who will be looked at as one of the biggest missed opportunities of the last 20 years would be a top 5 draft pick for Emory. But sure, him and Pace draft the same way To be fair to OP, Trubisky was the 2 overall pick and the highest draft pick Emery had was 14.   In fact, Pace has had a top 10 draft pick in each round save for 2019 so the talent hes drafted should be better than Angelo and Emery who had a top 10 draft pick only twice over the course of 15 seasons (2003 and 2005). So yeah, comparing Brock Vereen to Leonard Floyd is silly, but then again comparing average draft positions for Pace to guys like Emery and Angelo is also a faulty comparison too IMO.
fo49gp4	1587500487	Buccaneers	team	Good fucking deal. Pats had little leverage.
fo49gqa	1587500487	Patriots	team	The team had no leverage, better to get something for him. Gronk could have become reinstated and fucked us over with 10 million cap hit.
fo49gs1	1587500488	Patriots	nfl	I mean, clearly the Patriots had the leverage considering they own the coveted asset. But they got a very solid deal so everyone should be happy.
fo49h1w	1587500492	Patriots	team	Okay...  Tom and Bill couldnt get on the same page. It sucks but I can live with that. But this.... now Im pissed.
fo49gu7	1587500489	Giants	team	Soon as I read D I knew who it was P Wills is going to look so good in That Giants Uni haha
fo49h73	1587500493	Patriots	nfl	Existence is pain.
fo49gm4	1587500485	Eagles	nfl	His value is probably higher... but because there was only one team to go (TB12s), his value is low.
fo49gtt	1587500488	Cardinals	team	Okay, well thought experiment isnt if wed go 1 choice with Rosen. Moreso if Kyler  8 is better than Burrows  Bosa.
fo49gz0	1587500490	Raiders	nfl	L O Fucking L
fo49h64	1587500493	Patriots	team	Bill is fucking losing it. Just give up the GM title.
fo49heb	1587500496	49ers	nfl	Poor NFC South if Gronk comes back looking completely rejuvenated after taking a year off.I just dont know how you defend those 2 monster WRs and GronkHoward or Brate. Now imagine they also take Justin Jefferson to man the slot. Hell the whole NFL should be scared, not just the South.
fo49gpj	1587500487	Buccaneers	team	LETS GOOOO
fo49gzo	1587500491	Buccaneers	team	It was reported hes in game shape
fo49h14	1587500491	Patriots	nfl	(
fo49h1a	1587500491	Chiefs	nfl	Thats a steal for New England. The draft is basically only 4 rounds so they got a free pick.
fo49h4o	1587500493	Bengals	nfl	Inb4 Edelman requests trade too
fo49h80	1587500494	Eagles	nfl	Why cant they just go away. Make the bad man stop
fo49h7z	1587500494	Lions	team	Youre acting like hes freaking Ernie Sims, who I think grew up in the town where Dorothys house killed the wicked witch of the East.  Simmons is a big fucking dude
fo49hie	1587500497	Browns	team	Placed the bet 2 days ago and the under was 105, the movement to 160 jives with new rumors though
fo49h1b	1587500491	Titans	nfl	Are yall ready for some 5048 final scores between the Bucs and Saints???
fo49hak	1587500495	Bears	nfl	I am guessing he probably doesnt have enough desk space to put 7 monitors in his office  only 1 or 2.  At least he is prepared.  Hopefully we make good choices....
fo49hq4	1587500500	Buccaneers	team	Thats really not fair lol. Imagine getting a tackle, running back and a mid round receiver in the draft to fill out the rest fill out the rest of the offense. Defense almost wouldnt even be a concern with how powerful the offense would be.
fo49htl	1587500501	Steelers	nfl	Evans, Godwin, and Gronk. What in the actual fuck
fo49h8a	1587500494	49ers	nfl	Its not wrong for someone to be more of a fan of players than a team. Plus, who cares?
fo49hbm	1587500495	Buccaneers	nfl	How? We can now trade Howard and get those picks back.
fo49hbp	1587500495	Bills	nfl	Id love to see this, just for the fact that it would be spicy draft day drama and almost no one would see it coming.That being said its quite unlikely because 1. Dak is a good QB (imo) and 2. Theyd need to have a trade for him lined up as well or theyll lose out on a lot of value. Now trading Dak and getting a top 10 (plus more or giving up more?) pick back could be interesting
fo49hf8	1587500496	Colts	team	Stephen Holder clarifying the Hooker newsOnly a true Colts fan would read this title and immediately assume it was about a football player.
fo49hn5	1587500499	Patriots	team	For a 4th round. Unbelivable
fo49hru	1587500501	Raiders	nfl	Wooooow
fo49i1p	1587500504	Falcons	nfl	Every GM in the NFC south just started making calls to trade up for Simmons
fo49hmb	1587500499	Eagles	nfl	So better keep both then. Have OJ play the Aaron Hernandez role minus the murders
fo49hqs	1587500500	Chargers	nfl	Whats the recommended way to become a sports analystreporter and how much should someone expect to earn? Sorry if its off topic you have a job that seems like a dream haha
fo49i0h	1587500504	Jets	team	Such a ridiculous statement lets take the homerism down a little bit
fo49hz2	1587500503	Jets	team	this still? we dont know if anyone was offering to trade up since there werent any top qbs to move up for. So, without even knowing there was a trade down offer, i dont understand how you can assume there was one. Quinnen was hurt a good bit and being used as gap stuffer this past year. Not to mention they fired the GM who made all the decisions and we cant go back in time so why harp on this.
fo49i2r	1587500505	Patriots	team	He was just traded for a 4th round pick.
fo49i4i	1587500505	Patriots	team	Trade him for oj Howard and Tom Brady
fo49iax	1587500507	Buccaneers	team	Wow. What the fuck is this timeline?
fo49ie9	1587500509	Buccaneers	nfl	Theyre going to trade OJ.
fo49hp1	1587500500	Patriots	nfl	I gotta sit down
fo49hzu	1587500503	Patriots	team	LOL.....
fo49i71	1587500506	Saints	nfl	Seriously fuck the NFC South this year.
fo49i89	1587500507	Buccaneers	team	WHAT A SNAG FIRE ME AND THOSE CANNONS UP RIGHT NOW
fo49inc	1587500512	Eagles	nfl	So pass 100 times a game?
fo49i2a	1587500504	Falcons	nfl	Fuck
fo49i50	1587500505	Patriots	nfl	Its not the Bucs its Brady. Gronk  Brady is a better combo then they have
fo49ibl	1587500508	Chargers	nfl	Two of the three
fo49icp	1587500508	Patriots	team	The guy didnt want to play for us so what can we expect, it feels like we got shafted but what can we do?
fo49iid	1587500510	Buccaneers	team	As awesome as this would be, this still feels like a pipe dream. Yall see what Gronk looks like lately? All his muscles went bye bye in retirement lol. He would have a long way to go in order to play. But I hope it happens of course.
fo49imq	1587500512	Buccaneers	team	AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH
fo49io0	1587500512	Patriots	team	I bet the Bucs Cut OJ Howard now, freeing up Bill to negotiate a new deal with him.  The Bucs were probably trying to off load him in the deal and Bill was like No, cut him
fo49isf	1587500514	Giants	nfl	If they are going to play Fitzpatrick for at least a year why not get a less refined guy like Jordan Love who showed improvement in college and has ridiculous athelticism.
fo49iu0	1587500514	Jets	nfl	I was looking in the Patriots sub and they really thought they were getting OJ Howard and are like a 4th really thats it Lmaoo
fo49ixn	1587500516	Giants	nfl	Its not a 4th, its a trade up from 7th to 4th.And the entire conversation started because someone proposed a Gronk for OJ Howard swap
fo49iau	1587500507	Lions	team	Chase Young at 3
fo49ilu	1587500511	Buccaneers	nfl	500 points
fo49iuu	1587500515	Chargers	team	Theyll probably come before that honestly
fo49iyg	1587500516	Titans	nfl	Bucs. theyd rather have Yannick
fo49ihi	1587500510	Seahawks	nfl	So um Amazon you say package arriving today by 8 PMYou also dont have the package marked as shipped so...
fo49ikf	1587500511	Cowboys	nfl	This will never happen.  Thats crazy  rnfl 30 minutes ago
fo49ilc	1587500511	Vikings	nfl	Goddamn Licht strikes again
fo49ioj	1587500512	Dolphins	nfl	Thank you Mr. List Man
fo49ipx	1587500513	Patriots	team	We got fucking finessed
fo49isr	1587500514	Steelers	nfl	Yeah as long as Arians is there I dont see AB going to TB. Arians never liked him and I imagine the things that have transpired in the last year and a half didnt help that
fo49iza	1587500516	Cowboys	nfl	Completely agree. Or Romo leading a game winning drive only to have the defense give up enough yards in 42 seconds to set the opposition up for a game winning FG.
fo49j9e	1587500520	Raiders	team	Hes overrated if you cant figure out how to use him. How well he plays is a direct reflection of who his DC is. I think the only mistake you can make with him is to ply him as an every down inside the box LB He doesnt love to thump against OL on run downs. he excels in space. Clemson moves him everywhere but usually reserved the inside the box alignment for passing downs where he could match a back, blitz, or spy qb.He played a lot over the slot or dee safety on early downs where he excels both filling the run as well as in coverage
fo49izm	1587500516	Buccaneers	team	Congrats guys. Looking forward to watching you this year.
fo49j5w	1587500519	Lions	team	How do people hate this man?Like I get being annoyed by MPs repeated euphamisms and personality but BQ just seems like a good guy and its not like his drafts have been garbage. You can disagree with moves he makes but the pure hatred some people have for people theyve never even met astounds me lol
fo49jbz	1587500521	Steelers	nfl	Who cares? He wasnt going to return to play for NE, so it doesnt matter to them what he may or may not be this year (and I wouldnt be so quick to discount how a year off can affect a player, though I tend to agree with your assessment).The point is they had a player who wasnt going to play for them and wanted to play elsewhere and basically moved up three rounds in the draft for free.
fo49jhj	1587500523	Patriots	team	Lol you guys are acting like we traded 2011 Gronk dude was cooked his final year and took a year off we were not getting much
fo49jib	1587500523	Buccaneers	team	WOW... Patriots fleeced?? Im a transplant Bucs fan, and Im pumped! LFG
fo49ius	1587500515	Buccaneers	nfl	Adding Gronk doesnt get TB that much closer to the Superbowl, we already have an above average Brate who was Red Zone magic with Winston, Brady to Brate is going to be a TD machine inside the 20.Thats without adding Howard to the equation. Maybe with Brady bringing accountability and the willingness to chew your ass to pieces for not doing your job will be the boost OJ needs to finally play up to his potential.Ill roll with those two over Gronk. Unless New England wants to trade us an offensive lineman, I hope this is more bullshit AB to Tampa rumors because these reporters have literally nothing else to do than drum up fantasies.
fo49iwx	1587500515	Panthers	nfl	Damnit
fo49j3o	1587500518	Patriots	team	Couldnt have put it better myself
fo49j5q	1587500518	Bears	nfl	I wonder how much Gronk coming back is actually due to weed than Brady.
fo49jdj	1587500521	Broncos	nfl	Maybe a, uh, very specific subset of people. A very specific subset easily identified by a recognizable logo next to their username. Yes, those people.
fo49jkb	1587500524	Colts	nfl	one of these things is not like the other...
fo49jno	1587500525	Patriots	team	Bruce Arians offenseGo back to when they didnt have a coach that hates tight ends touching the ball
fo49jt7	1587500527	Patriots	nfl	In my native language PUTANG INA.
fo49jvi	1587500528	Redskins	nfl	A Winnebago?! Lone Starr...
fo49jfe	1587500522	Jets	nfl	Lol enjoy watching Brady and Gronk in another jersey
fo49jiz	1587500523	Eagles	nfl	 Reddit users circa November 7, 2012 237 AM
fo49jn6	1587500525	Patriots	nfl	The Patriots have all the leverage.  Gronk wants to unretire and only go to one team.  The Patriots have his rights.  The Bucs have zero leverage.  Hard to believe theyre only getting a 4th.
fo49jnl	1587500525	Patriots	nfl	Ah youre right I forgot how good Kelce has been. Gronk was still top 3 until 2018 then?
fo49jo0	1587500525	Patriots	nfl	Hes a Hall of Fame tight end. The emotional part of me wants an embarrassment of riches. The even more emotional part of me is screaming WHY NOT DO THIS MONTHS AGO.
fo49ju1	1587500527	Eagles	team	Ya, thats what Im saying him being defensible is because of that, not cause Philly is actually scary. Sounds like were on the same page. Me too man, me too. I love Philly. Nowhere else quite like this city.
fo49jyq	1587500529	Eagles	nfl	They were never assembling a football team, they were assembling Voltron. Jesus fucking christ
fo49k16	1587500530	Patriots	team	people shouldnt be surprised about Gronks value
fo49jm9	1587500524	Buccaneers	team	What the hell is happening this year lmao.
fo49jnk	1587500525	Bills	team	And more than double the Super bowl wins.Oh wait...
fo49k5t	1587500532	Patriots	team	Guys, he wasnt doing any good for us retired. I know a lot of people wanted more than a 4th, but he looked spent his last year here and has been away for a year. Its better than him staying retired, at least we got something for him.
fo49k0b	1587500530	Lions	team	I heard the other day Okudah didnt commit a penalty in 2019. I say we draft him for that reason and that reason alone lol. 1 less PI call per game i bet increases our wins by 12year.
fo49k10	1587500530	Patriots	team	Another fleece by another team to us after Sanu.
fo49k1n	1587500530	Redskins	team	Trade is done. Gronk  a 7th for a 4th
fo49k3a	1587500531	Buccaneers	team	Cant wait to see you guys drop 50 on our swiss cheese defense
fo49k7x	1587500532	Eagles	team	They also ran 11 man personnel during most of that time.
fo49k9p	1587500533	Bears	team	Especially since Shaheen is going to go down with a shin injury halfway through and not finish cutting the yard.
fo49jty	1587500527	Eagles	nfl	This story went from 0100 real quick
fo49jyx	1587500529	Patriots	team	Yeah, and only 3 Super Bowls in 5 years...fuck outta here
fo49k2s	1587500531	Dolphins	nfl	Remember last year when you idiots almost let him have AB before AB ABed himself?Feels like a century ago.
fo49k76	1587500532	Cardinals	team	I agree. Theres something to Kylers swag and work ethic that really stands out to me. I think that alone puts him above Burrows for me.
fo49kit	1587500536	Patriots	team	I mean, it sucks Gronk is gone, but hes playing with Tom, and we got a 4th out of it, wasnt expecting his value to be that much, more then what Lynch got and he was a older RB.Still hurts though...
fo49kpl	1587500538	Chiefs	nfl	He countered it by himself becoming a meme in general
fo49k7v	1587500532	Patriots	nfl	Stay away you vultures, hes ours.
fo49k8x	1587500533	Bears	nfl	dude what the fuck lmao
fo49k99	1587500533	Chiefs	nfl	Everyone get in here!!
fo49kfk	1587500535	Chargers	team	So cute
fo49khz	1587500536	Jets	nfl	Ahhh this was the NFL GM that Thomas Dimitroff was alluding too when he mentioned a Teams GM was considering putting an IT guy in an RV near his place.
fo49kvm	1587500541	Patriots	team	Cant they just not activate him?
fo49kbs	1587500534	Redskins	team	But you just created controversy by doing that at all?
fo49ke2	1587500534	Buccaneers	team	Unbelievable congrats
fo49kgw	1587500535	Patriots	nfl	Its pretty awful. I would rather try to get gronk to unretire from us, even if we have to sit on it a couple more years. This 4th is useless to us. Its a multi year rebuild, one 4th when its going to take multiple entire drafts to be able to compete again is useless
fo49ki3	1587500536	Seahawks	nfl	He could just retire again and youd be stuck with nothing tho and he only has one team he wants to play for.
fo49kna	1587500538	Saints	team	
fo49kr6	1587500539	Patriots	team	Does this seemed planned now? Like Brady and Gronk talked about this a year ago? Gronk retired to heal up and save a year of injuries. And Brady prepared his contract to leave?
fo49kxh	1587500541	Patriots	nfl	I will lol
fo49kl7	1587500537	Patriots	nfl	Why?
fo49kmt	1587500538	Patriots	team	I really dont think we have that much leverage. Gronk has a 10 mill cap hit
fo49kn8	1587500538	Titans	nfl	LEROY PREDICTED IT
fo49kso	1587500540	Buccaneers	team	24 seconds
fo49kwu	1587500541	Bears	team	You must have gone on game day.
fo49lcu	1587500547	Patriots	nfl	Have him block all regular season only to tell him go score a touchdown in the super bowl.
fo49lgt	1587500548	Chiefs	nfl	Dez, Jordy, and MBC are all still available, too.
fo49l3z	1587500544	Packers	nfl	Gronk hasnt played in 16 months, has chronic problems in his knee and back, and has dropped weight. How tf did people expect New England to get more?
fo49l6v	1587500545	Redskins	team	Trade already done. httpstwitter.comAdamSchefterstatus1252693001450782721?s19
fo49l99	1587500545	Patriots	team	Oh true I forgot about him.
fo49la0	1587500546	Jets	nfl	This is way more fun when its not in your own division
fo49lcv	1587500547	Buccaneers	team	Ive honestly kind of avoided discussing this because I dont want to jinx it but itd be an absolute shocker for us not to win it all this year right? I mean this is absolutely insane
fo49lqx	1587500552	Patriots	team	This is different. Hes the goat TE at 31 coming off a year of recovery. Worth it IMO if Im the bucs trying to win now.
fo49l34	1587500543	Packers	nfl	I mean, Hernandez didnt ruin the Patriots and he killed some people.
fo49lb4	1587500546	Seahawks	nfl	Having sex is terrible for your health.
fo49lba	1587500546	Redskins	nfl	April fools!
fo49lfo	1587500548	Seahawks	nfl	Oj Howard gonna get traded
fo49lnv	1587500551	Bears	nfl	LEEROY WAS RIGHT! Good boy!
fo49ltm	1587500553	Giants	nfl	The Buccaneers have now traded for a retired HC and a retired TE.
fo49ldz	1587500547	Broncos	team	Well you better find a place to store those bricks
fo49lga	1587500548	Falcons	nfl	The NFC South is gonna be the most competitive and fun division.
fo49li2	1587500549	Seahawks	nfl	Holy shit.
fo49lji	1587500549	Patriots	team	Aaaaaand he didnt produce then, either.
fo49ljq	1587500549	Buccaneers	team	Even that DJ trade up in the first was stupid. Gronk is expensive, high injury risk, and hasnt played in a year. Pats were never getting that much for him.
fo49lkg	1587500550	Giants	team	True, but I suppose thats really the entire drafting on need versus talent view point. I still think the defense could use more help than the offense which is why Im hoping for Simmons.
fo49lmz	1587500550	Buccaneers	nfl	Three TE sets baby
fo49lsg	1587500552	Browns	nfl	But hes had a year off and can smoke weed. Hes prolly gonna fuckin go off
fo49lu9	1587500553	Patriots	nfl	Yeah I know. Lofty. Getting a 4th
fo49m0j	1587500555	Patriots	team	Kind of a shit trade, even if Gronk wasnt doing shit as a retiree
fo49lzc	1587500555	Patriots	team	Seriously. I feel like in 2016 we somehow entered an alternate reAlity
fo49m1g	1587500555	Buccaneers	team	Called it(httpswww.reddit.comrbuccaneerscommentsg22pdolivelookatthebayrightnow)That means we have a deal for OJ, somewhere. Redskins for Trent?
fo49lrh	1587500552	Panthers	team	What the heck, the Buccs were always the team I hated least. Now what do I do?
fo49lw6	1587500554	Saints	nfl	Finally something goes Tom Bradys way.
fo49lzz	1587500555	49ers	nfl	You dare doubt the mighty Jeff Bezos
fo49m3z	1587500556	Rams	nfl	Thank you! Theyre actually very easy to make!
fo49m6y	1587500557	Patriots	team	Gronk is a player coming out of retirement with a long injury history. What did you think we were getting?
fo49m8q	1587500558	Patriots	team	I actually see this as a good thing for the Patriots. Bill is about to get value from a player who otherwise would not be playing. Especially from a team that has a better (at this current point) disgruntled TE in Howard who is clearly on the outs. I dont see Bill being petty and I think he will try to find whatever value he can for a player who otherwise would not matter to their gameplan moving forward.
fo49me4	1587500560	Steelers	team	You act like having 3 good players guarantees a dynasty or something, Andy Reid coached for like 20 years and just now won a ring.   Its way harder to get there then you act like it is
fo49m5g	1587500557	Patriots	nfl	I agree more, fuck this in the asshole
fo49mbx	1587500559	Bears	team	Look, i see your point, but thats all down to lucking out with getting jordan, getting hot for two seasons in baseball, and complete new regime change for the blackhawks in like 2006 or so when wirtzs kid took over and actually cared. Yeah, its good now, but really look at right before bulls winning in the 90s back to the 60s. Thats a whole generation of suckass across every team with the greatest defense and rb to play the game only winning one super bowl. Lets not even talk about the Chicago Trashfire
fo49mgi	1587500561	Buccaneers	nfl	Very surprised they kept both for their TEs
fo49mhb	1587500561	Patriots	nfl	I never said anything about the quality of the pick. I said to assume Belichick has to take something and like it is false.
fo49mne	1587500563	Buccaneers	team	God, we better make the playoffs now
fo49mtg	1587500565	Bears	team	Thats overpaying
fo49m0u	1587500555	Buccaneers	nfl	Lmao you fucking thought youd get a second.
fo49m3p	1587500556	Eagles	nfl	Damn Gronk is really on the Bucs that offense is kind of absurd lol
fo49m4e	1587500556	Buccaneers	team	Do they build the statue of Gronk in front of Mons Venus now or wait a few years?
fo49m4p	1587500557	Bears	team	I would be really surprised if Hurts turns into a regular starter in the NFL
fo49m69	1587500557	Patriots	team	Lol
fo49m9n	1587500558	Bengals	nfl	httpswww.thiswebsitewillselfdestruct.comthis is fucking amazing50 of it is serious shit and 50 of it is memes
fo49mb7	1587500559	Seahawks	nfl	drinking and banging chicks is more healthy than getting banged by 11 dudes every week for 3 hours.
fo49mc5	1587500559	Redskins	team	For me, it would depend on what the Skins get in return, and who they actually traded me. My limit would be going back to 5, but I could accept 6 if the Chargers gave up their 1sts for the next three years. But I dont see that happening.
fo49mry	1587500565	Lions	team	My fantasy draft would be trade down for 5,6. Then trade up to 1114 (one of them) and get Chaisson.
fo49mty	1587500566	Packers	nfl	Thank you Based List God
fo49mgt	1587500561	Patriots	nfl	Already done my man. We were never swapping 1sts. Gronk and a 7th for their 4th pending physical
fo49mn4	1587500563	Steelers	nfl	A 31 year old Gronk coming out of retirement due 10 mill is not worth a pick swap, not even close.
fo49mso	1587500565	Seahawks	nfl	2020 is wild
fo49mvi	1587500566	Patriots	nfl	Hit em with that uno reverse card
fo49mxe	1587500567	Patriots	team	Lol you are delusional if you think we will have a better record than the Bucs
fo49n45	1587500569	Dolphins	team	Oh, youre right. Being talked about as a first round talent from draft analysts is all bullshit, but this one guy on Reddit knows everything. Makes total sense.
fo49n6h	1587500570	Patriots	nfl	uskinnyreesescup I am shook
fo49mke	1587500562	Patriots	nfl	Hes under contract, which in this situation gives him all the leverage. If he unretires he has an immediate cap hit, and were not exactly overflowing with cap space. No other team will trade for him if hes going to immediately reretire, so basically its whatever the Bucs give, cut players to account for him, or cut him and get nothing.
fo49mox	1587500564	Packers	nfl	Goodnight NFC South
fo49mqf	1587500564	Patriots	nfl	Bruh it was a joke. Dumb ass
fo49mtz	1587500566	Dolphins	team	httpswww.pff.comnewsdraftthreeroundpffanalystmockdrafttuatagovailoagoesno2overalltowashingtonchargerssnagjordanloveinround3I want young so badly (especially since Im an OSU fan)
fo49n14	1587500568	Buccaneers	team	Its official, hes on the team
fo49n78	1587500570	Falcons	nfl	The Pats can trade him to another team. That is their only option if there is 0 other suitors. They arent forced to trade him to Tb and if they dont hes retired. Unless some other team trades for Gronk to trade him to the Bucs but doesnt seem like any world where that would make sense for TB.
fo49ngk	1587500574	Colts	nfl	League fucked.
fo49nin	1587500575	Seahawks	nfl	shit might be too late but if you havent ordered, get the gravy on the side that way its not soggy when you get it
fo49mun	1587500566	Seahawks	nfl	You gotta be fucking kidding me... 2020 continues to get weirder as we go on.
fo49mwb	1587500566	Raiders	nfl	The Tompa Bay Patriots. Plenty of TEs for Tom. (OJ Howard should still be traded to somewhere like the Bears, or Bengals for cheap)
fo49n13	1587500568	Seahawks	team	The restriction is that the base color cant change, but decals can which is what the Chargers are doing. Might change next season tho hopefully.
fo49n9a	1587500571	49ers	nfl	Ive been on the phone dealing with work calls all day. I swear I got laid off two weeks ago...
fo49npy	1587500577	Patriots	nfl	Go get Fournette or Melvin Gordon then
fo49n42	1587500569	Patriots	nfl	Okay have fun explaining to your new QB that just left his last team because he was unhappy that you couldnt bring in the most dominant TE ever and best player hes had for the last decade because OJ Howard and a draft pick was too much
fo49ncu	1587500572	Patriots	nfl	He aint playing for anyone else other than with Brady so we dont really have leverage.
fo49nkk	1587500575	Patriots	team	Mike Vrabel announces his retirement from coaching to unretire from playing to join the Bucs
fo49nky	1587500575	Lions	team	Hes got his fucking bat . We might pull this off.
fo49nr6	1587500578	Eagles	team	Multiple suspensions. Lack of experience because of said suspensions. Lacks discipline, both in and off the field. Easily fooled and often out of position. Overly aggressive in pursuit and often takes poor angles to the football. He has insane physical traits, but his mental game doesnt seem ready for the NFL. Im not saying he wont get there, but hes definitely not there yet.
fo49nrd	1587500578	Browns	nfl	This is the football equivalent of LBJ bringing Wade to Cleveland for a cup of coffee.
fo49ng4	1587500573	Patriots	team	This would have been an incredible addition
fo49nh7	1587500574	Patriots	nfl	I hate this offseason so much
fo49nig	1587500574	Patriots	team	Do we get a comp pick for him?
fo49njf	1587500575	Lions	nfl	This was quick. So theyll surely be trading oj. Gronk and brate will still be a Good room
fo49nqo	1587500578	Buccaneers	team	YOLOSZN
fo49nqq	1587500578	Dolphins	nfl	Have fun NFC South.
fo49nu3	1587500579	Jets	nfl	So thankful hes gone
fo49nw2	1587500580	Ravens	nfl	Which was entirely bad coaching. They abandoned the run way too early.
fo49nwr	1587500580	Buccaneers	team	49ers fan would yall be interested in running backs ?
fo49nzh	1587500581	Panthers	nfl	Please
fo49o5e	1587500583	Patriots	team	This sucks!
fo49o9u	1587500585	Patriots	team	All hes worth is a damn 4th are you shitting me....
fo49oab	1587500585	Patriots	team	got a 4th rounder for a player who didnt want to play for us anymore, can live with that. The missing second round pick this year still hurts though
fo49oaf	1587500585	Buccaneers	team	Tampa Bay back on the map!!!!!
fo49nij	1587500574	Patriots	team	Free 4th
fo49nl3	1587500575	Patriots	team	Lets see.Gronk wasnt going to play for the Pats.Gronk was extremely limited his final season here.I figured he would get a 4th straight up, but throwing in a 7th isnt a drastic value change.
fo49nmk	1587500576	Patriots	team	Lol
fo49nua	1587500579	Titans	nfl	This happened so fast.
fo49nwe	1587500580	Patriots	nfl	Emphasis on a little Johnson.
fo49nzw	1587500581	Bills	nfl	Id love if Adams left the Jets. Maybe thats just me.Its interesting that you say you have no draft capital given the buzz of you guys moving into the top 10 for Henderson
fo49o10	1587500581	Buccaneers	team	Brady always giving that team friendly deal.
fo49ogr	1587500587	Buccaneers	team	Enjoy your two contending years guys, after these two years its back to being irrelevant
fo49ois	1587500588	Ravens	nfl	Sounds like to me you guys got bad value for the greatest tight end of all time. Yeesh
fo49olt	1587500589	Patriots	team	Recent precedent for this is Lynch who was retired for the Raiders who was traded to Seattle. The Seahawks gave up a 5th and got a 6th back. We have zero leverage so its basically what TB is willing to give us and we have to take it or not. I say a 4th at best.
fo49o1o	1587500582	Steelers	nfl	I mean...they certainly dont have D  D writing it if it is. This is some season 14 shit right here.
fo49o6p	1587500583	Patriots	team	Lol
fo49o6m	1587500583	Chiefs	nfl	Theyd have Howard if they wanted him. His value is even lower than Gronks. People just overrate it because he was a high draft pick, but teams dont care about that anymore.
fo49o6t	1587500584	Chargers	nfl	He probably will during a game or hell get attacked in the locker and have to sit out the game.
fo49o7j	1587500584	Buccaneers	team	Thats what Brady has always done. Since his rookie contract was up hes always taken team friendly contracts well below his worth. Its part of the reason why the pats were so good for so long. They were getting an A QB for a B salary
fo49obj	1587500586	Panthers	nfl	Wait... There buccs have two legit top tier tight ends that have been playing great with a garbage can throwing to them.This would be a move that adds nothing of value to the team. It literally just gets people to gossip. This is stupid if its true.
fo49oka	1587500589	Buccaneers	nfl	Bucs legends TB12 and Gronk
fo49om4	1587500589	Eagles	nfl	dont you drag the Jags into this, theyve literally done nothing to anyone
fo49o5r	1587500583	Saints	nfl	Fuck this division
fo49okk	1587500589	Chiefs	nfl	I just like that both Brady and Gronk are playing on a different team.Its good for the Pats as a whole, but Im petty.
fo49okn	1587500589	Bears	nfl	Brady, Evans, Godwin, now Gronk.RIP NFC South Defenses
fo49oxg	1587500593	Patriots	team	The way I see it is its a fourth for magic beans. We dont know what Gronk is gonna be this season, although I certainly hope he racks up TDs like its nobodys business just because I love the guy
fo49p1g	1587500594	Steelers	team	Edmunds just isnt good. I dont see the insane reasons why people here defend him.
fo49ofc	1587500587	Cowboys	nfl	Except their line sucks and the quarterback will probably decline from his average year but yeah those things arent important
fo49og0	1587500587	Panthers	nfl	Howard for Fournette skrait up?
fo49ohw	1587500588	Buccaneers	team	2020 is fucking wild
fo49oxp	1587500593	Vikings	team	Rick keeps BTFO of Tomasson when he tries to cut ahead of the other reporters.
fo49ojc	1587500588	Cowboys	nfl	Im just starting to feel like were going down that Eagles Dream Team path at this point
fo49om7	1587500589	Lions	nfl	Gronk and a 7th for a 4th.What a time to be alive.
fo49oov	1587500590	Patriots	team	Lol
fo49os7	1587500591	Patriots	nfl	Gronk could still unretire and force their hand. With 10 Million over the cap, theyd have to release him or find a way to unload his cost.
fo49ota	1587500592	Lions	nfl	Obviously not
fo49p5z	1587500596	Steelers	nfl	Honestly what the fuck does Kraft have on these other owners? These trade deals are crazy
fo49p8s	1587500597	Patriots	team	No reason to be upset. Theyre playing for a team not even in our conference. I can still cheer them on and be ok with it.
fo49pbu	1587500598	Falcons	nfl	We live in a simulation in which I keep getting fucked
fo49osb	1587500591	Redskins	team	What that was fast.
fo49ot4	1587500591	Packers	nfl	This is going to either win them a Super Bowl or a 1 pick the year after.
fo49pg3	1587500600	Patriots	team	That would require cap space haha
fo49p3y	1587500595	Patriots	nfl	He isnt going to report and mope around while also playing for the pats lmao. And if he comes out and holds out they dont have to pay him. The leverage the pats have is that this trade cannot happen without them executing it. Gronk should not have much value at all, but saying they have zero leverage is just false
fo49p9c	1587500597	Buccaneers	team	Called it(httpswww.reddit.comrbuccaneerscommentsg22pdolivelookatthebayrightnow)That means we have a deal for OJ, somewhere. Redskins for Trent?
fo49pjd	1587500601	Titans	nfl	you mean there are other ways to run offense?
fo49prw	1587500604	Panthers	nfl	Brate is fucking disgusting in the red zone. Dont sleep. How do you stop this team down there??
fo49ps7	1587500604	Buccaneers	nfl	Why are my pants wet
fo49pik	1587500601	Patriots	nfl	4th and a 7the apparently.Im stoked tbh. Free picks for a guy who retired. Yes please
fo49plv	1587500602	Broncos	nfl	What a fucking year we live in
fo49pmq	1587500602	Patriots	team	We didnt even get anything good in return what the fuck
fo49pn7	1587500602	Dolphins	team	Bro, I have been going through this shit since Marino retired.  There are no guarantees we are turning this around just because of one draft.
fo49po0	1587500603	Saints	nfl	What about the double murder?
fo49pta	1587500605	Redskins	team	That was fast... pending physical also.
fo49pdp	1587500599	Patriots	nfl	Not really, I was expecting a 3rd to be the best we could get
fo49pg0	1587500600	Chargers	team	Could have been sweet to do all of the bolts in an outline like the navy one.

fo49prq	1587500604	Patriots	team	Should edit great full before the reddit grammarspelling squad arrive, Ill delete my post also.
fo49pvp	1587500606	Patriots	team	At least we got something for him (
fo49q1y	1587500608	Broncos	team	You need to do this picture again with the Rams logo as the kid outside the circle, and all the kids in the circle are just variations of the Chargers logo.
fo49q42	1587500609	49ers	nfl	Gronk and a 7th rounder to the Bucs for a 4th pending a physical  Rapaport.  Damn
fo49pu3	1587500605	Packers	nfl	Wheres that,  Its happeniiiing clip?
fo49pw8	1587500606	Patriots	team	Fireable fucking offense. A FOURTH ROUNDER? ARE YOU SERIOUS!!!!!
fo49q08	1587500607	Buccaneers	team	how do we have the cap space for this trade (gronk being 10M) and our draft class? can gronk restructure his contract? or is another move expected soon
fo49q2t	1587500609	Patriots	nfl	That is still a relationship, which is what Hopkins is saying didnt exist. There was an actual, personal relationship developed but the hierarchy of bossemployee was still there. And in the NFL its far more nuanced than bossemployee relationships that youd have with your boss. Nearly every major contributor to a franchise has a voice, and if they dont its usually considered dysfunctional. We expect the relationship between star players and coaches to be more involved because these are critical assets to the team. Plenty of players get the normal bossemployee treatment, but those are like deep roster guys. That happens the be most of the league. What you dont expect is the same treatment to be applied to the star players. The rules may be applied the same, but the actual relationship is often different.
fo49q2g	1587500609	Patriots	team	Please stop.Brady was very visibly upset back in training camp when he was asked about his new one year contract.
fo49q57	1587500610	Broncos	team	Excommunicado
fo49q9s	1587500611	Bengals	team	Joe who?
fo49qbm	1587500612	Patriots	team	We didnt have leverage. If Gronk filed for reinstatement Pats would have had to clear 9 million in space since his contract would have hit the books immediately. The 4th is fine and was a gravy pick for a retired player. It sucks because it is Gronk of all people. Just wanna know if its 117 or 135 now.
fo49qdt	1587500613	Saints	nfl	And a piece of loose leaf paper playing Oline
fo49qfe	1587500613	Patriots	team	we gave up a 7th too...tbf its for a 30 year old TE who had bloody calves after the last time he played so well see how it turns out
fo49qjr	1587500615	Jaguars	nfl	Just give them the ring now
fo49qk2	1587500615	Redskins	team	Worst deal ever
fo49qlp	1587500616	Packers	nfl	The 2017 Chiefs showed every way that the Atlanta Falcons were inept.  The Chiefs were a good team with a good quarterback.  They drafted a very talented rookie QB when they already had a good quarterback.  They saw the potential in that rookie quarterback enough to be able to coach him up and give him a future while still coaching the starter while winning games.  Alex Smith went to the pro bowl and Mahomes became the best quarterback in the game.  The Falcons on the other hand, started their Pro Bowl quarterback and made their talented rookie a side show.  Not properly giving him the coaching, reps, and attention he needed.  Letting him rot on the bench with little to no shot to play.  Chris Miller had a good season and turned back into what he was before, a bottom of the barrel starting quarterback.  If we even compare Alex Smith to Chris Miller, Alex Smith was far superior at that time and had a good track record.
fo49qpd	1587500617	Patriots	team	Ill leave this up to show how naive I was
fo49pzp	1587500607	Steelers	team	Lmao soneone crosspost
fo49q23	1587500608	Patriots	team	9 Super Bowl trips, 6 championships. Seriously, go fuck yourself with this shit. Dynasties end, it happens, and its almost always ugly as all hell. Do you know that it would have been easy to get Howard? How do you know that?
fo49q31	1587500609	Seahawks	nfl	Goddammit I hope we have football this season
fo49q9q	1587500611	Colts	nfl	Why isnt Barry being given credit, he broke this story a few weeks ago. smh
fo49qd9	1587500613	Patriots	team	We got no leverage hes either playing with tom or not at all.
fo49qnl	1587500617	Colts	nfl	Daniel Jeremiah was this close lmao
fo49qoa	1587500617	Buccaneers	team	Imagine telling anyone after Jameis threw the pick six against Atlanta that wed have Brady and Gronk the next year lol.
fo49qd2	1587500613	Patriots	team	The fuck is this
fo49qpc	1587500617	Browns	nfl	Great passing offenses, meh running offense. Better hope Bradys 42 year old arm holds up.
fo49qq1	1587500617	Patriots	team	Could have easily gotten OJ Howard. Joke
fo49qpk	1587500617	Packers	nfl	Jordy got no respect when he played, at least not nearly as much as he deserved
fo49qpw	1587500617	Saints	nfl	I cant believe Im saying this but, uh.... I am actually scared of the Bucs this year.Why did this have to happen to us.
fo49qqi	1587500618	Patriots	nfl	Literally will not believe it till I see him take the field lmaoDude was a CORPSE last time he played and that was 2 years ago.Man said he spent the entire night after winning the super bowl crying from how much pain he was in.
fo49qqz	1587500618	Colts	team	The Patriots(httpstwitter.comhashtagPatriots?srchashtagclick) and Bucs(httpstwitter.comhashtagBucs?srchashtagclick) have agreed to terms on a trade Tampa gets Rob Gronkowski and a 7th rounder in exchange for a 4th rounder, sources say.    httpstwitter.comRapSheetstatus1252693880308477952(httpstwitter.comRapSheetstatus1252693880308477952)
fo49qsh	1587500618	Patriots	team	What. The. Fuck.
fo49qtd	1587500619	Ravens	nfl	Is it though? Then whyd they only get a 4th?
fo49qvw	1587500620	Raiders	nfl	Meh. Take it or leave it.
fo49r1r	1587500622	Vikings	nfl	Literally every one of these are unreal.
fo49r2u	1587500622	Colts	team	I dont think Ballard wanting Hooker to play better means hes going to get traded. Also, players tweet cryptic shit all the time that ends up being entirely unrelated to football. I agree with this statement...I guarantee that hell be traded if Ballard feels like the offer is good enough....because I think thats true for almost every player. Few players are untouchable if the offer is good enough. Im not saying he wont get traded, but I also dont think its inevitable, nor do I think this stuff points to a trade.
fo49r64	1587500623	Patriots	nfl	 I actually see this as a good thing for the Patriots. Bill is about to get value from a player who otherwise would not be playing. Especially from a team that has a better (at this current point) disgruntled TE in Howard who is clearly on the outs. I dont see Bill being petty and I think he will try to find whatever value he can for a player who otherwise would not matter to their gameplan moving forward.
fo49qni	1587500617	Chargers	team	If he wins a SB with the colts do you think Dad will ever come back... 
fo49qs6	1587500618	Buccaneers	team	Hold the fucking phone a second. Yall will be lucky to get a 6th rounder for a retired player. Stay away from OJ. Thats assuming gronk can pass physicals. There is so many what ifs to this
fo49qsf	1587500618	Dolphins	team	That can happen to 100 of the players in the NFL
fo49qtw	1587500619	49ers	nfl	WUT
fo49qvo	1587500619	Cowboys	nfl	And I really mean thisWhat a time to be alive.
fo49qx4	1587500620	Bills	nfl	Well if they do decide to trade OJ Howard and get a 4th or lower then you could argue that that was the value but the oats didnt have the space. You cant just say that because he wasnt traded for Howard means that thats crazy value. Truth is we dont know how the league values Howard untilif hes traded
fo49qyo	1587500621	Buccaneers	nfl	Im sooo happy
fo49r1f	1587500622	Steelers	nfl	In this case, a 20 soaked in beer and protein powder
fo49raf	1587500625	Buccaneers	team	Never gonna happen. Gronks body would literally fall apart if he took one more hit.
fo49rcn	1587500626	Cardinals	nfl	Good luck Bucs. Arians wasnt great with TEs in AZ
fo49rgj	1587500627	Saints	team	I live in GA and fuck Brian Kemps dumb ass. We dont even have a lead on it (no thanks to him) and were gonna reopen the most high contact places. Rumor is if you go to a bowling alley, nail salon, barber shop and gym all in the same day, Kemp will just shoot you in the face himself as a reward instead of making you wait for the virus.
fo49qxm	1587500620	Redskins	team	Lemme get some of that OJ?
fo49qzz	1587500621	Saints	team	Its happening, Schefter just tweeted it.
fo49r3q	1587500623	49ers	team	more than it would cost for Engram
fo49rch	1587500626	49ers	nfl	I aint gonna lie, I thought for sure NE would at least get Howard.If Gronk looks refreshed after a year off, the Buccs got a steal. Even if he doesnt, giving up a 4th is not a big gamble or anything.
fo49re9	1587500627	Packers	nfl	Wouldnt surprise me.
fo49rf5	1587500627	Bills	nfl	Hes a top zero TE from his living room, which is where he was going to be if they didnt trade him
fo49riz	1587500628	49ers	nfl	Were in the top 3 in 2 TE frequency, hed get a shit ton of playing time and a good amount of targets
fo49rno	1587500630	Buccaneers	team	Yes .
fo49roi	1587500630	Buccaneers	team	I measured and mine is a Gronkapproved 420.69 millimeters, though I may be adding a few TV remotes and a can of red bull  to the total
fo49rpn	1587500631	Broncos	nfl	Unfair. Wow, just wow lol.
fo49rs1	1587500632	Patriots	team	How? Were getting rid of Gronks contract
fo49rsv	1587500632	Texans	nfl	GRONKA BAY
fo49rww	1587500634	Seahawks	nfl	Wow this is not news I expected to ever see. Unreal
fo49rcu	1587500626	Patriots	team	 we have literally no bargaining power besides saying no. That is really it. What would a team give up for a 30 year old TE who has had major injury concerns and has been out of football for a year? I dont care if he WAS the best ever. Teams dont paytrade just on past accomplishments. We have no space to take on a player before the draft so right now it is picks. Sure you can try to restructure but that takes two to tango.  And we need to get to at least the required amount to sign picks.
fo49rd1	1587500626	Chargers	team	Just got my shipping confirmation today! Ordered the day they were released but worth the wait 
fo49rf8	1587500627	Buccaneers	team	Whats next Edelman wants out too? 
fo49rfb	1587500627	Patriots	nfl	Not bad compensation... this is about what I expected. We got something out of nothing. Sucks that I have to see Gronk in anothee uniform too (
fo49rg7	1587500627	Lions	team	Lawyers would (justifiably) contend that the draft has greater value as a media event than as a sporting event. Media is essential.
fo49rj1	1587500628	Eagles	nfl	I mean he was retired, so technically he could just do a cycle of PEDs and get huge again then get off long enough to pass tests once he unretires lol
fo49rp6	1587500631	Patriots	team	I know it sucks that gronk might go to the bucs with Brady but think of the players we could get for him. OJ Howard and a second maybe? Would be good
fo49rrl	1587500632	Eagles	nfl	Stick through it when theres some slow pacing. The show gets very good when it finds its rhythm
fo49rvr	1587500633	Patriots	team	Thought we would get more... lol
fo49s2r	1587500636	Bills	nfl	Likely OJ imo
fo49s5n	1587500637	Patriots	nfl	Yup just saw. Fuck
fo49s5k	1587500637	Patriots	team	Lmfao fuck Gronk.
fo49rl0	1587500629	Jets	nfl	Hey its not in our division anymore, Ill allow it
fo49rlx	1587500630	Bears	nfl	damn i cant believe reddit.com is reporting that unolanthenerd thinks i cant use logic, i wonder if well ever hear this from them firsthand
fo49rr1	1587500631	Lions	team	Hes probably the best gm Ive had in my life. Not a high bar, but still.
fo49rtg	1587500632	Browns	nfl	No longer in the AFC either. We have a chance!
fo49sfm	1587500641	Buccaneers	team	Pats fans thought theyd get a first or O.J.
fo49sfo	1587500641	Redskins	nfl	What?
fo49s01	1587500635	Raiders	nfl	Can confirm. Had sex and 6 months later tore my MCL and Meniscus while running
fo49s1h	1587500636	Panthers	nfl	Sounds like my ex
fo49s31	1587500636	Broncos	team	U actually talkin to Talib himself
fo49s30	1587500636	Patriots	team	For having basically no leverage with either Gronk or the Bucs, I was surprised we even got a 4th versus a 5th round pick (or deferred pick until next year)
fo49s35	1587500636	Patriots	team	Sucks and I mean really sucks that now both Gronk and Brady will be playing for a different team, but this a good return for a player who was retired a day ago.
fo49sbz	1587500639	Bears	nfl	Pretty good trade, Pats got a 4th in a supposedly deep WR class from a retired vet, Bucs get a high upside TE while not giving up anything incredibly valuable.
fo49seq	1587500640	Patriots	team	This is a wild year. That Bucs offense is a QBs dream.
fo49sha	1587500641	Seahawks	team	This.  Its all about the era.  You dont change your uniform unless youre trying to change your identity.
fo49s6h	1587500638	Dolphins	nfl	Fuck Nick Saban
fo49san	1587500639	Redskins	team	True Im sure he passes it though
fo49sax	1587500639	Patriots	team	This happened fast
fo49sd3	1587500640	Falcons	team	Yeah this is more like the first SB where we just got smoked the entire game.  It looked like the new covid cases were starting to drop and then boom yesterday we had like the second most cases yet.  It is like the beginning of third quarter where we are losing but were going in for a touchdown and coach Kemp is just sending in the scrubs thinking that they can pull it off.

fo49sx9	1587500648	Texans	nfl	Lmao OJ Howard 
fo49sy7	1587500648	Patriots	team	I have never seen that more prominently on display then watching the Jags team get dismantled this past years or so. Player on my team  good. Same player got traded 14 minutes ago  he was never good anyway.
fo49sva	1587500647	Patriots	team	Ill take that bleach now.
fo49sws	1587500648	Patriots	nfl	And Earl Thomas said he would have no problem tackling Derrick Henry. Sometimes things dont go the way you expect

fo49sq9	1587500645	Patriots	team	This isnt OJ Howard...
fo49ssq	1587500646	Eagles	team	Id never boo you Nick
fo49stg	1587500646	Saints	nfl	How the hell in one offseason did Tampa go from not on my heated rival list to switching with carolina behind Atlanta?
fo49sxs	1587500648	Buccaneers	team	Its already official my man
fo49sxu	1587500648	Cowboys	nfl	Thats his contract if he fills it aka he goes to work. Right now, hes not getting that money, but if he decides to play again, the Pats have his current deal.
fo49t0z	1587500649	Patriots	team	Not getting O.J. Howard either.
fo49t9j	1587500652	Packers	nfl	Just a little off there
fo49tf2	1587500654	Eagles	nfl	Looking good for one more year of brady in my fantasy dynasty league
fo49thq	1587500655	Buccaneers	nfl	How the hell did we make the money work, also both sides win.
fo49tma	1587500657	49ers	nfl	Well that was quick
fo49tfl	1587500654	Redskins	team	Under the final 8 games with Haskins at QB they averaged 21.5 though
fo49tm2	1587500657	Patriots	nfl	Hes obviously indicating he wants to play. That would be a pretty silly bluff. I mean, I think the compensation they got for a retired player is pretty clear evidence that they had leverage.
fo49tua	1587500660	Patriots	nfl	Its a 4th for Gronk7th
fo49tx3	1587500661	Chiefs	nfl	Am I the only one who doesnt think these are that cool?
fo49u18	1587500663	Buccaneers	team	Who says we dont just keep OJ?
fo49ti4	1587500655	Patriots	team	Just an FYI, I was legitimately asking. Not saying I had all the info haha
fo49tky	1587500656	Patriots	team	Everything hurts.It hurts so much.
fo49tl4	1587500657	Dolphins	team	A small stepping stone for Tua to Boston
fo49tn4	1587500657	Patriots	team	Not exactly the kind of pick I wanted but hey its more draft capital.
fo49tpz	1587500658	Patriots	team	Highly unlikely hes either playing with Tom or not at all we got no leverage.
fo49tsc	1587500659	Dolphins	nfl	By swap firsts you mean a 7th and gronk for a fourth?
fo49tsg	1587500659	Lions	team	If they move someone, youd think itd be a 29year old Cameron Brate who is due 1 million more than Howard.
fo49tu8	1587500660	Vikings	nfl	You said and. So I listed another tackle their age. Nobody says a word about reiffs age and theyre the same age
fo49twq	1587500661	Patriots	team	We really just traded the greatest tight end of all time for a 4th round pick
fo49tzf	1587500662	Packers	nfl	Woohoo
fo49u5t	1587500665	Saints	nfl	Man, they might make it to 88 this year. Hell yeah
fo49u6b	1587500665	Eagles	nfl	Unless Howard is officially a big bust Im not sure why this had to happen. Gronk was already declined to a shell of himself by the time he retired, and you gave up a decent pick for a guy who hasnt played in a year. I dont see why you guys should bail on Howard. Maybe Gronk has some resurgence but its a pretty weak TE class. I get youre in win now but you cant win now with Howard?
fo49u8g	1587500666	Redskins	team	Gronk gets traded for a 4th and we still have people here who think Trent is worth more than a 3rd.
fo49u8j	1587500666	Patriots	team	Jay Glazer reporting the Gronk already took a Bucs physical. Its happening  lets just get something good out of it like the PierceKG to Brooklyn trade.It is what it is. Im making the most of this and boarding the ship for 2020. AVAST!
fo49tuk	1587500660	Chargers	nfl	Now the NFC will experience what the AFC has experienced on a weekly basis.
fo49u16	1587500663	Falcons	nfl	The Patriots are gonna turn that pick into another Hall of Famer, arent they?
fo49uin	1587500670	Patriots	nfl	Honestly I think thats a big win. My thought (and most others) is we were going to be getting a 5th or later.
fo49ujn	1587500670	Cardinals	team	whether or not its the right pick is a subject of high debate here latelyHuh? Theres only been about 9 or 10 posts about it... Daily
fo49tya	1587500662	Buccaneers	team	We could end up keeping OJ and trading Brate.
fo49u3l	1587500664	Chargers	team	Brb need to rub one out.
fo49u4b	1587500664	Buccaneers	team	Fuck off
fo49u5z	1587500665	Lions	nfl	Literally just did.
fo49uf9	1587500668	Jets	nfl	Brady proving he can win without Belichick by playing with the greatest supporting cast of all time.
fo49ug2	1587500669	Panthers	nfl	What does that even mean? I love Cam, Im just a realist. A guy thats been dealing with injury for 4 straight years is probably never going to be healthy again.
fo49uqu	1587500673	Eagles	nfl	UNREAL! I cant wait to buy Madden this year.
fo49u7f	1587500665	49ers	nfl	Pretty nice return for the Pats
fo49u7x	1587500665	Patriots	nfl	Its not like the Patriots previously didnt try trading him. Free picks tbh
fo49u84	1587500666	Titans	nfl	The best league
fo49uag	1587500666	Falcons	nfl	Or Okudah. I think this really highlighting the fact that we need a corner
fo49ujw	1587500670	Patriots	team	Would have much rather acquired him in a a trade under his current cheap contract than have to negotiate a new, presumably much higher contract if released
fo49uke	1587500670	Lions	team	Bob Quinn We dont like many of the offers weve seen yet and wouldnt mind staying put on draft day if nothing wows usrdetroitlions theres no way this man could lie to us, we must take him at his word
fo49uoh	1587500672	Buccaneers	team	Youre not happy about it?
fo49uv8	1587500674	Saints	nfl	Never thought Id see myself fighting side by side with a Falcons fan
fo49v0x	1587500676	Eagles	nfl	I heard the Patriots need a TE and have an extra 4th round pick.
fo49uf6	1587500668	Cowboys	nfl	This is madness.
fo49um2	1587500671	Patriots	team	With the hole at TE and OJ Howard on the trade block this is pretty unacceptable in my opinion. This should have been OJ Howard for Gronk and a 6th. Wild.
fo49uty	1587500674	Patriots	team	Lol gronk was a shell of himself. We got a free 4th for nothing.
fo49uuw	1587500674	Saints	nfl	are we supposed to hate the buccaneers now, or wait until antonio brown joins them
fo49uzx	1587500676	Bears	nfl	JEEEEEEANNNNKINS!

fo49uk3	1587500670	Patriots	team	Im no fucking NFL trade expert, but... thats it? A 4th rounder?
fo49uo0	1587500672	Chiefs	nfl	If someone is betting 67K on a prop bet they can probably point to that in their net income if any questions arose.  Hes probably just a middle man at the end of the day.  Find some high roller pro gambler and have him put in some bunk bets
fo49v0n	1587500676	Dolphins	team	You outta your mind haha
fo49v3t	1587500678	Giants	team	Im looking at the board and there are a few options for the giants to trade down and still get their choice Offensive Tackle. If they want Simmons, they can only move down with the Dolphins and Chargers really  and even the chargers is iffy. The Giants also have to bid against the Lions in any trade down scenario. Anyway, I think the following are reasonable potential trades1) 5 from Miami, the Dolphins give us a 3rd rounder maybe to prevent the Chargers from leaping them. Giants get to pick the same player they would at 4.2) 6 from LAC, the Chargers want to jump the Dolphins to get their QB and give us a 3rd rounder to get in front of Miami. Compensation is weird because this is bidding war with 2 buyers and 2 sellers. Anyway, the Giants get to pick the same player they would at 4.3) 9 from Jacksonville, the Jaguars dont want to roll with Minshew  wont wait for Lawrence next year so they jump up to grab Tua or Herbert. Giants probably get the Jaguars 2nd rounder (42) for this. Giants probably get the second tackle off the board here.Trading down further than that would require a lot of compensation, wed miss out on at least 3 and probably all of the top 4 tackles, and I dont think Gettleman wants that.Thoughts? Personally Id be happy to get one or two mid round picks from the Jags to move to 9 and grab the best tackle there.
fo49v5x	1587500678	Titans	team	Im down. Tye has been good for us when hes needed to step up. Im glad hes sticking around.
fo49v63	1587500678	Bears	team	He didnt answer the question.
fo49vbl	1587500680	Saints	nfl	Then why the hell do I feel like shit then?
fo49vc5	1587500680	Patriots	team	They only got a 4th
fo49vg1	1587500682	Patriots	team	Is fucking Jules and Hightower next? Im about to stop watching football in general
fo49vjj	1587500683	Patriots	team	WORST. DAY. EVER.
fo49vli	1587500684	Titans	nfl	They essentially traded a 7th for a 4th.
fo49uu3	1587500674	49ers	nfl	What would you want? I know the Niners have had feelers out on guys like OJ and Engram, but we have no midrounders lol
fo49uwa	1587500675	Patriots	team	Thats it!?
fo49uza	1587500676	Bills	nfl	YO SOY FIESTA
fo49v01	1587500676	Patriots	team	I mean, its better than nothing
fo49v1a	1587500677	Chargers	team	He play....   And most importantly....    He slay.
fo49v2e	1587500677	Lions	team	Okudah 100
fo49v2j	1587500677	Patriots	nfl	Hard to attack that trade as a Pats fan though. We traded a first rounder for Cooks and we considered him a rental. The fact that Cooks trade value has remained so high is questionable, but the dude can ball. He just has some serious concussion issues that make him risky.
fo49v2z	1587500677	Titans	nfl	These are incredible.  Idk how I feel about the number on the helmet yet, but the uniform itself is beautiful.
fo49v4g	1587500678	Buccaneers	team	He already took it and passed it and we got a 4th
fo49v4o	1587500678	Steelers	nfl	rbrandnewsentence
fo49v6i	1587500679	Jets	nfl	This is so much fun when it isnt in your division
fo49v77	1587500679	Giants	nfl	Hes still just 31 years old and just had a year to get healthy and recover with no PED testing restrictions.I think hell be better than people think
fo49vbf	1587500680	Patriots	team	This fucking sucks
fo49vck	1587500681	Redskins	nfl	Melvins a Bronco...
fo49vdj	1587500681	Chargers	team	I want to see all the unis with just the bolt outline like that, super slick!
fo49vdp	1587500681	Chiefs	nfl	Conference, even
fo49vdy	1587500681	Rams	team	Jonathan Greenard, EDGE, Florida
fo49vfj	1587500682	Lions	team	Well I believe that Stafford is much easier to take off the books 2 seasons from now. Have him play this year. Maybe even the following if we draft lawrence to give him someone to learn from. But Id agree blow it up. Keep Kenny Kerryon and the center on offense (sadly name slipping my mind right this moment) blow up the rest of the offense and rebuild. The defense theres nothing to blow up at this point. Its just trash all around
fo49vh0	1587500682	Steelers	team	Welcome to LeSean McCoys Cornee
fo49vnf	1587500685	Vikings	team	Technically both are mercenaries, one just got traded after getting drafted.
fo49vb8	1587500680	Cowboys	team	Yep. Im okay with giving a 5th for him, but nothing more
fo49vbe	1587500680	Eagles	nfl	It is on paper. What makes it even more insane is that these are all toys that belong to Bruce Fucking Arians....
fo49vsd	1587500687	Patriots	team	Sounds about right
fo49w16	1587500690	Dolphins	team	I mean they got a 4th round pick for a player that was basically retired for them.   Id say they made out pretty well.
fo49w1y	1587500690	Dolphins	team	pats get a 4th rounder for nothing
fo49w3z	1587500691	Titans	nfl	Lol you dont
fo49w4t	1587500691	Falcons	team	Welp......we definitely trading up now.
fo49vlg	1587500684	Patriots	nfl	do not want
fo49vlo	1587500684	Browns	team	I thought the mods were going to delete less posts during the off season? It seems like most posts are getting deleted(httpssnew.notabug.iorbrownsnew).
fo49vq5	1587500686	Steelers	nfl	God save us all
fo49vql	1587500686	Saints	nfl	NFCS skill positions are hype as FUCK
fo49vs8	1587500686	Patriots	team	Absolutely.  This makes us better. I dont care where Gronk is, I want the Patriots to be better.  Would love Howard too.
fo49vte	1587500687	Patriots	nfl	lol oh shit
fo49vw8	1587500688	Colts	nfl	Claim suck it losers hes ours
fo49vwk	1587500688	Patriots	nfl	He wanted to play for Brady. Not NE
fo49vwq	1587500688	Buccaneers	nfl	Tampa Bay Patriots
fo49vx9	1587500688	Seahawks	nfl	Wow that was quick from rumor to official
fo49vxe	1587500688	Jaguars	team	I know its not as pertinent, but Id prefer the fan eating out the foam sticks
fo49vy7	1587500689	Bears	nfl	Romo is what the Bears wish Trubisky would be. Ryan Pace wanted his Drew Brees 2.0 but this is what Trubisky could have been. Fuck, man.
fo49w1x	1587500690	Cardinals	nfl	Buffalo Man  Arizona Man  Florida ManQuite the evolution string
fo49w48	1587500691	Patriots	team	Fuck Tom Brady too
fo49w5i	1587500692	Patriots	nfl	The meme team 
fo49w5v	1587500692	Falcons	team	We need Keanu back.
fo49wcx	1587500694	Bears	team	Dont hate it Arnette can play, I personally think Trevons gonna fall a little bit so I think they could trade back their 43 and still grab him in the mid 50s. But the one thing Ill say with Corners this year is its deep but only really at Nickel, after Arnette outside corner gets real thin so I for sure want one of the 2 first picks being an outside corner.
fo49vs7	1587500686	Steelers	nfl	Wtf is this shit?
fo49vyj	1587500689	Patriots	team	OJ Howards cap hit this year is 1.98 million
fo49w1m	1587500690	Patriots	team	He must literally have said he either plays with Brady or not all. Might as well take what we can I guess, wish him well.
fo49w5f	1587500691	Patriots	team	Tampa bay must be very happy
fo49w9x	1587500693	Bills	nfl	I mean, when healthy and over a year ago, before he dropped and has to re add a bunch of weight. To act like this is gonna be a sure thing is insane
fo49wah	1587500694	Patriots	team	Ridiculous
fo49wdo	1587500695	Patriots	team	Fade me bothers, this is bitter.
fo49wdu	1587500695	Packers	nfl	Bucs can go recoup that 4th by trading Howard too
fo49wl0	1587500697	Patriots	nfl	No, you have Brady but please dont take Gronk too...
fo49wli	1587500697	Patriots	nfl	Yeah I agree. Just dreaming big over here
fo49w7n	1587500692	Patriots	team	The way I look at it is we went from a retired Gronk (no value) to a 4th (decent value)
fo49wav	1587500694	Patriots	team	Yeah, I expected way more. 2nd? OJ?
fo49wbk	1587500694	Patriots	team	Looks like its a 4th for Gronk and a 7th.
fo49wbx	1587500694	Bears	nfl	HELLO MR OJ I ALWAYS THOUGHT GUYS NAMED OJ HAD EXCELLENT CHARACTER
fo49wg8	1587500695	Jets	nfl	Cameron Brate in shambles
fo49wgl	1587500696	Falcons	nfl	Otherwise what? Drove a car a little too fast down a highway? Come on who hasnt done that before
fo49wk0	1587500697	Buccaneers	nfl	Dont think hed count against their cap
fo49won	1587500699	Raiders	nfl	Gronk got tired of WWE in less than a month lmao
fo49wtn	1587500700	Patriots	nfl	Big gulps hey, welp, see ya later
fo49wwd	1587500702	Buccaneers	team	Wait, what?
fo49wh4	1587500696	Eagles	team	12 personnel has been our best personnel grouping the past two seasons, even when we did have Alshon and Agholor. Perhaps it would have been different with DJax healthy freeing up the intermediate areas with his speed, but we wont have that after next season and that would be an indication that we probably need an outside, deep threat WR. The other consideration is that youre suggesting removing a proven commodity who would be at least a top 10 TE on any other team as their starter for a player who is at his best in the slot and fills a similar role. Im not saying that it would be that same result, but why would you go back to the well after both JMatt and Agholor failed to succeed on the outside after being best projected to play the slot (like Jefferson is being projected). Outside WR is our biggest hole and, again, a position where Goedert and Ertz are both serviceable playing so they all fit the same role and using a 1st on a player with a similar skillset probably isnt the best use of resources. Versatility is good, but Jefferson has underwhelmed on the outside and has issues playing press, which he will see a lot more of in the NFL. And, while I know that youre being hyperbolic, this isnt Juju or Thielen. If that were guaranteed, thats one thing, but thats not the case, otherwise Jefferson wouldnt be in play for us at 21.
fo49wh6	1587500696	Jaguars	nfl	Or conference
fo49wh7	1587500696	Chargers	team	Hate that I dont wear hats or jerseys because I feel left out now.
fo49wir	1587500696	Buccaneers	team	Other than injury concerns...Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you like the play?
fo49wjh	1587500697	Buccaneers	team	No fucking way 
fo49wjm	1587500697	Dolphins	nfl	I think theyd much rather try and trade up from 13 to grab one of the top 4 tackles than trade back to 23 and gamble that Jones gets by the Dolphins, Jags, or Vikings
fo49wk5	1587500697	Giants	nfl	thats WWE 247 Champion Gronk
fo49wou	1587500699	Buccaneers	team	THIS WAS MY IDEA
fo49wpw	1587500699	Chargers	team	Nice! Ive been trying to order them for a while and every time I heard they were back in stock they were sold out.
fo49wyu	1587500703	Buccaneers	nfl	I honestly dont want to get rid of OJ even though we have Gronk, and Brate isnt that expensive just say fuck it and keep them all.
fo49wzu	1587500703	Titans	nfl	Agreed. From the outside looking in, as not a Tampa fan, this feels like a winwin
fo49x2y	1587500704	Rams	team	Im not a Rams fan, just a football fan who has an interest in team branding and uniform design.The Rams logo does indeed suck very hard. Their uniforms are really good and have an iconic look thats hard to mess up. I think youll be okay there.
fo49x3e	1587500704	Colts	nfl	This Gronk thing happened so fast what the hell
fo49x3h	1587500704	Panthers	nfl	Which is more dangerous duoGronkHernandez or GronkHoward?
fo49wpi	1587500699	Cowboys	nfl	Saban needs to quiet down. Yea he has had success in college but in the NFL, he was a bum.
fo49wt9	1587500700	Patriots	team	OH FUCK OFF Brady got us 6 rings go fuck yourself.
fo49wtp	1587500700	Bears	nfl	stfu jay
fo49wwm	1587500702	Cardinals	nfl	Im calling it now they wont be anything special
fo49wyb	1587500702	Buccaneers	team	Just out of curiosity, what would you guys expect for OJ Howard?
fo49xc1	1587500707	Buccaneers	team	Even as a patriots fan I think Id be very excited to see that run happen! Still gotta remember these are the older slightly worse versions of the two GOATs.. but with some other exceptional weapons that never existed on the pats either to be fair. Either way congrats! So much fun to look forward to for this squad.
fo49xk8	1587500710	Patriots	team	fuck it we can rep two teams
fo49x3b	1587500704	Jets	nfl	Whats going to give you more value next year Gronk partying somewhere, or whoever you take in the 4th?
fo49x42	1587500705	Patriots	nfl	That Bucs offense will be unreal. OCs dream.
fo49x7z	1587500706	Rams	team	I get the hate for our yellows but honestly I love them.  I remember back in the day Trumaine Johnson even had this custom hood jersey made and I wanted it so bad.  I still do, Tru if youre reading this please.
fo49xgc	1587500709	Saints	nfl	MY DAY GOT SHITTY. GRONK AND BRADY IN NFCS. UGHHHHHH
fo49xma	1587500711	Patriots	team	agedlikemilk
fo49xme	1587500711	Patriots	team	Is this surprising in any way? Hes previously said hed rather retire than play for anyone but brady. It doesnt matter what team Tom is on.
fo49xn9	1587500712	Patriots	team	Belichick need to go. How many bad trades and draft picks has he made holy shit.
fo49xpj	1587500713	Chargers	nfl	Now we can all focus on Mahomes and Lamar
fo49xr0	1587500713	Jaguars	team	Gotta have those dongles
fo49x3d	1587500704	Patriots	team	What a crap return
fo49x5l	1587500705	Patriots	team	Fuck Tua, sick of hearing about him. Hell be lucky not to be completely broken by the time his first contract is up.
fo49x8z	1587500706	Ravens	nfl	The Patriots have about as much leverage as the Seahawks did with Lynch a few years back. The Raiders gave up a 5th and the Seahawks gave them Lynch and a 6th.
fo49xbi	1587500707	Chargers	nfl	Good start
fo49xbf	1587500707	Cowboys	team	Amari breaking the rules?  Now theyve gone too far
fo49xbx	1587500707	Buccaneers	team	Very surprised they kept both of their TEs.  Just get an OT and RB and its a wrap.
fo49xeu	1587500708	Colts	nfl	We need Eli back
fo49xiu	1587500710	Patriots	team	I really thought wed get more fuck man Ill miss you gronky
fo49xj6	1587500710	Steelers	nfl	So is Gronk gonna still perform in the WWE???
fo49xjl	1587500710	Buccaneers	team	real classy douchebag
fo49xnm	1587500712	Vikings	nfl	Wow didnt think Gronk would be back. He seemed content with retirement.
fo49xve	1587500715	Patriots	team	Screw this
fo49xgl	1587500709	Panthers	nfl	Maybe the murders gave him his power. Like how it makes a Waffle House cook make such delicious food. I wont even touch a plate of hash browns without at least one teardrop tattoo.
fo49xmd	1587500711	Bears	nfl	Thats a great return for a guy who was just retired.I dont believe Gronk is going to be anywhere near where he was prior to retirement and he still has to prove he can actually stay healthy.
fo49xr4	1587500713	Saints	nfl	If he is in shape lol
fo49xuz	1587500715	Cowboys	nfl	F5 season is back
fo49xsh	1587500714	Patriots	team	They are getting a 4th for him.
fo49xvd	1587500715	Buccaneers	team	It just doesnt seem likely to me. Bruce doesnt seem to care for OJ.
fo49xvg	1587500715	Colts	team	His weapons are insane!!
fo49xwr	1587500715	Eagles	nfl	Yup. Thats basically how Jason Peters career started. He learned technique along the way, but its hard to get past a dancing bear in a helmet.
fo49xxp	1587500716	Patriots	team	Brady gonna get the entire Patriots squad by the time the season starts.
fo49xxz	1587500716	Bears	team	Hes won everywhere hes played, has a prototypical build, and could be picked up in later rounds. I get the appeal, but being realistic and thinking of some of the later round players theyve drafted in years past, I dont see it.
fo49xym	1587500716	Patriots	team	I want Tampa to get nuked tbh
fo49xz1	1587500716	Cowboys	nfl	Bucs got their guy.
fo49y2b	1587500717	Packers	nfl	That was the year Bradford lit up the Saints in week 2 and immediately tweaked his knee.By playoffs time he was reported to be back and the rumors of if he could play started.Im not sure if they ever said either way or not but he wouldve been the much better option if possible.
fo49y2i	1587500718	Patriots	team	Gronk chooses his last year to spend with Brady instead of New England
fo49y3q	1587500718	Bears	team	Agreed, but I dont like the riskreward on most of the QBs in this draft except Burrows.
fo49y4e	1587500718	Buccaneers	team	Give us OJ you cowards 
fo49y5b	1587500718	Bills	nfl	They got a 4th round pick for a retired, broken TE.
fo49y6y	1587500719	Buccaneers	team	Well take it
fo49y96	1587500720	Bears	nfl	GOATs are reunited and it feels so good!
fo49y97	1587500720	Jaguars	nfl	Cry more
fo49y9j	1587500720	Vikings	team	Doesnt really strike me as the unathletic, scrappy, lunchpail, gym rat type.
fo49y9r	1587500720	Patriots	nfl	WHAT!
fo49yal	1587500720	Jets	team	The tweet comes from a Philly sports personality, so theres that too.
fo49ybv	1587500721	Vikings	nfl	get AP to the bucs, would like to see him get a ring
fo49ydq	1587500721	Buccaneers	team	I love the move
fo49yfm	1587500722	Dolphins	nfl	overunder until he owns a tiger zoo?
fo49yjo	1587500724	Patriots	nfl	Also problematic that he probably only wants to play with Brady, so no competition for him.
fo49ykm	1587500724	Patriots	nfl	Take care of my sweet boys! Tommy and Rob on spring break In Tampa.
fo49ymu	1587500725	49ers	nfl	Hold on didnt Gronk retire?
fo49y0g	1587500717	Buccaneers	team	Big mad
fo49y8g	1587500720	Ravens	nfl	Now saying its a done deal. Front and a 7th for a fourth.
fo49y9h	1587500720	Patriots	nfl	Rather not have a fourth and not have Gronk playing.
fo49ydb	1587500721	Buccaneers	nfl	EVERYBODY GET IN HERE ITS HAPPENING
fo49ydh	1587500721	Jets	team	Watching highlights of Lamb, like you, I noticed he was wide open so often (thus the YAC). Im not on the Lamb train either. He doesnt really seem to go up and get it. Stats are inflated by potent offensive scheme that left him by himself more often. Personally Im on the Ruggs train.
fo49yqm	1587500726	Patriots	team	Grandpa Bill isnt dumb. He has a plan. Be patient.
fo49ytu	1587500727	Patriots	team	Better than expected. Raiders got a 5th and also gave up a 6th for Lunch last year. We had zero leverage. Had to take what we could get or nothing at all.
fo49yi5	1587500723	Chargers	nfl	No, theyre a throwback to the 70s80s Chargers jersey(httpsportsbyline.comwpcontentuploads201903Winslow.jpg)
fo49yjv	1587500724	Patriots	nfl	Im rooting for Brady to do well there so he can silence all the haters that say he would have been nothing without Belichick.
fo49yml	1587500724	Redskins	team	Trent didnt have to retire because of injuries
fo49ynr	1587500725	Steelers	team	I agree with you about Haden, but Im absolutely not convinced our front office can draft defensive backs. Its too bad though, because in theory its a great place to land for a young CB with Haden and Nelson there to learn from.
fo49yom	1587500725	Patriots	team	Kill me now
fo49yrs	1587500726	Redskins	team	Yeah probably, but just remember he retired because of a ton of concussions and an injury list longer than a CVS receipt.
fo49yvl	1587500728	Dolphins	nfl	I cant believe Im saying this, but BUCS STACKED LEAGUE FUCKEDIf all parties are legit healthy. Though Gronk with a year off and no drug testing makes me think hes going to ball out.
fo49z70	1587500732	Patriots	team	We are just got a 4th. Sigh
fo49yhs	1587500723	Seahawks	nfl	Now how do you feel hahaha
fo49yps	1587500726	Chargers	nfl	Tampa bay Patriots
fo49yrt	1587500726	Saints	nfl	if someone tackles him do they win the wwe 247 title?
fo49yui	1587500727	Patriots	nfl	We just gave them a gift, though its ridiculous. We give them a 7th and a big piece for them to try to win a SB, and they will still get a 2nd for Howard, and we get a 4th. This is a complete gift
fo49yve	1587500728	Bears	nfl	That would be smart but it seems like the Bucs really wanna get rid of Howard for some reason. Plus theyre gonna have to give up something to get Gronk. Bill isnt just handing him over for freee
fo49yw3	1587500728	Patriots	nfl	If they had no leverage they would have gotten worse than a 4th round pick lol. Anyone who thought they were swapping 1st is delusional, but a mid round pick for a retired, injury prone player is not nothing
fo49ywk	1587500728	Browns	nfl	Well thats rude. But I meant we collectively as in the AFC
fo49yzl	1587500729	Patriots	nfl	They are both past their primes. But what that means is they are still pretty good.
fo49yzn	1587500729	Jets	nfl	F to this comment lol
fo49z2l	1587500730	Falcons	team	Does everyone get why we need a corner now? Henderson, or maybe even Okudah or Simmons are who we need to pick.
fo49z5s	1587500731	Patriots	team	Im willing to bet he has more value than whomever we have at TE now?
fo49z6p	1587500732	Giants	nfl	Vince McMahon is probably pissed right now.
fo49z6y	1587500732	Patriots	team	Idk man I mean look at Reggie Wayne. I feel like they look at playing on the pats late in their careers as just not fun. They are probably both confident in where they stand in history and just want the oppurtunity to focus on playing highlight or bust football over crazy efficient and technical chess game that the pats are year after year.
fo49z83	1587500732	Cardinals	nfl	Jokes on them, Arians never utilized the TE in Arizona, Gronk even said he wanted to be drafted to Arizona but the Cardinals didnt see him as a fit
fo49z8t	1587500733	Patriots	nfl	The bucs play AT New England in the 2021 season
fo49zab	1587500733	Patriots	team	Season was already in the toilet and now it hurts emotionally too
fo49zi7	1587500736	Dolphins	nfl	I am staying mum for jinx reasons until after the draft.
fo49z0o	1587500730	Patriots	team	The fuck are they going to do with three TEs?
fo49z4d	1587500731	Falcons	team	My reaction(httpsyoutu.be1054DWkdnuI)
fo49zky	1587500737	Colts	team	Now TB is even more likely to deal Howard. Id be interested in the Colts going for him
fo49zmy	1587500738	Jets	nfl	I would LOVE a JetsBrowns AFC Championship... 2020 has been very weird just saying...
fo49z97	1587500733	Broncos	nfl	Whyd you list Gronk twice
fo49zdv	1587500734	Bears	nfl	Holy SHIT
fo49zih	1587500736	49ers	nfl	Poor NFC South IF Gronk comes back looking completely rejuvenated after taking a year off.I just dont know how you defend those 2 monster WRs and GronkHoward or Brate. Now imagine they also take Justin Jefferson to man the slot. Hell the whole NFL should be scared, not just the South.
fo49zkj	1587500737	Cowboys	team	its gronk and a 7th for a 4th.  OJ isnt involved
fo49zsv	1587500740	Bills	nfl	Where?
fo49ztg	1587500741	Patriots	nfl	Plus what? their 1st?
fo49zx0	1587500742	Rams	nfl	They absolutely should. Do all in and get a stud RB.
fo49zb7	1587500734	Giants	nfl	This is bullshit
fo49zbg	1587500734	Patriots	team	Yeah pretty much a later 7th to a mid 4th thats pretty good
fo49zcn	1587500734	Patriots	team	HOW DO YOU ONLY GET A 4TH ROUND PICK WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THE LEVERAGE
fo49zgm	1587500736	Saints	nfl	Oh yes. Thats exactly what I needed
fo49zgk	1587500736	Patriots	team	This is a great outcome for us. Expecting a 2nd rounder was nuts. This is practically a fourth round pick for free.
fo49zgn	1587500736	Patriots	nfl	nah man we clearly should have taken no tight end and a 7th instead of no tight end and a 4th
fo49zhm	1587500736	Bears	nfl	this is more like marshawn on the raiders, and marshawn was pretty decent on the raiders
fo49zjc	1587500737	Patriots	team	BAHAHAHAHAHA BUC NATION BITCHES!!!!
fo49zl3	1587500737	Cardinals	nfl	TAMPA TOM AND FLORIDA GRONK WE AINT READY FOR THIS
fo49zma	1587500738	Bears	nfl	K
fo49zp8	1587500739	Buccaneers	team	Guys  congratu fucking lations. As a life long Patriots fan, I am all aboard the TB train as long as Brady is there (and youre not playing the Patriots!). Gronk is just the icing on the cake.I dont know what you guys did to deserve this, but you do. Enjoy it, and I hope you make the Super Bowl!
fo49zws	1587500742	Patriots	nfl	I was hoping for a 3rd, but this seems right. hopefully 117 not 139
fo49zwv	1587500742	Steelers	nfl	No fucking way
fo4a00f	1587500743	Giants	nfl	Fuck
fo4a07g	1587500746	Bengals	nfl	So Tommy and Gronk can stay together?
fo49zj2	1587500736	Browns	nfl	Bro what
fo49zl8	1587500737	Vikings	nfl	I dont think OJ Howard is worth much.
fo49zmd	1587500738	Buccaneers	nfl	Our 1st rounder and some other picks of course.
fo49znt	1587500738	Packers	nfl	This is a preposterous deal for the Bucs
fo49zs5	1587500740	Buccaneers	team	Red FlagsOther than injury concernsOP implied theres more than one, try to read man
fo49zp7	1587500739	Patriots	nfl	I mean we turned a 7th into a 4th by trading a guy who doesnt play for us, that sounds pretty swell to meIts gonna be weird if Gronk actually suits up in another jersey though tbh
fo49zx5	1587500742	Patriots	nfl	If the chiefs can do it...
fo4a010	1587500744	Buccaneers	team	Id let it fly for a 3rd lol
fo4a04y	1587500745	Buccaneers	team	Most fanbases in the league would kill for two years of legitimate contention, Im sure they will enjoy it.
fo4a0gl	1587500749	Dolphins	nfl	Do you think Miami makes any big noise trades? With 14 picks they will most likely make at least one move.
fo49zy6	1587500743	Patriots	team	Wtf
fo49zyu	1587500743	Vikings	nfl	Im glad the Vikes arent in the NFC South
fo49zzc	1587500743	Ravens	nfl	 stay salty bro
fo4a03n	1587500745	Patriots	team	lol this should end all speculation that BB and Brady dont get a long. He just did Brady a MASSIVE fucking favor. Joke of a trade.
fo4a06l	1587500746	Saints	nfl	NFCS skill positions are so much fun. Holy shit.
fo4a08j	1587500746	Cardinals	nfl	Damn this hurts to read to be honest. Gronk got nothing else to prove. Just enjoy your life big guy!One more shot of him being helped off the field and I will cry.
fo4a09s	1587500747	Eagles	nfl	We live in someones Madden save.
fo4a09u	1587500747	Steelers	nfl	The what now?
fo4a0ah	1587500747	Buccaneers	team	Same tbh.
fo4a0bq	1587500748	Titans	team	Shes really made me happy to be a fan. Games are much more enjoyable and not just because were winning more.
fo4a0ey	1587500749	Patriots	team	4th for a guy who would have probably stayed retired anywhere else is decent
fo4a0he	1587500750	Patriots	team	What the actual fuck? We didnt get shit back for that trade. We couldnt ask for either brate or OJ?
fo4a0io	1587500750	Dolphins	nfl	NOT OUR PROBLEM NOW BOYS!
fo4a0l7	1587500751	Patriots	team	Gronk always said he had interest in playing football again. Why would he come back to play with Stidham and a rebuilding team when he could go to Tampa and play with Brady for another shot at a ring?
fo4a0mk	1587500751	Redskins	team	YES PLZ
fo4a0nu	1587500752	Patriots	team	What the fuck is this cursed timeline were in
fo4a0or	1587500752	Browns	nfl	MOM! WHERE ARE MY CHICKEN TENDIES? I CANT GET UP, YOU KNOW THAT!
fo4a0p1	1587500752	Redskins	team	Welcome to the Redskins OJ Howard!
fo4a0q8	1587500753	Patriots	team	What did you expect? He was cooked and he was only coming back to play in Tampa. Might as well take the free 4th rounder.
fo4a0u6	1587500754	Giants	nfl	They got their guy
fo4a0cg	1587500748	Patriots	team	Only return they got is a 4th. Which makes sense. We have no leverage. If we dont trade him., hes not going to play for us. We get absolutely nothing. If we do trade him, at least we get something
fo4a0dc	1587500748	Steelers	nfl	WILD!
fo4a0hj	1587500750	Jets	nfl	Great trade for the patriots lets be honest
fo4a0hg	1587500750	Patriots	nfl	 Literally will not believe it till I see him take the field lmao Dude was a CORPSE last time he played and that was 2 years ago. Man said he spent the entire night after winning the super bowl crying from how much pain he was in.
fo4a0i8	1587500750	Chargers	nfl	What about us? New unis are fire
fo4a0ld	1587500751	Rams	team	Yep.  Hates is an appropriate response to that thing   I just spent some money picking up some hats with the old logo just in case they stop selling it.
fo4a0tl	1587500754	Seahawks	nfl	What
fo4a0f1	1587500749	Seahawks	nfl	LMFAO WHAT
fo4a0fw	1587500749	Vikings	nfl	 But elite is like Top 3 really. Top 5 is pushing it, and close to Top 5 isnt elite IMO.I tend to have a formula for elite based on the number of players of that position are on the field at a time. Like if youre an elite QB, thats top 35. If youre an elite receiver or corner, thats like top 810 because there are so many of them. For DEs, where theres 2 on the field at a time, thats more like top 58 IMO.
fo4a0iy	1587500750	Bears	nfl	Jay Glazer 
fo4a166	1587500758	Steelers	nfl	Why the fuck not. In 2020Weve had massive countrywide fires.Nearly had WWIII.Kobe died.Tom Brady traded to the Bucs.Global pandemic that has shut down literally everything.This shit might as well happen.Whats next? Brees traded to the Chargers?
fo4a1ac	1587500760	Patriots	team	What did people expect for a retired, broken down TE with one year left on his contract and who wont play for anyone else?
fo4a0ox	1587500752	Panthers	nfl	This adds credence to Pats org not being fun to play in. Winning is fun, but once you have 3 Super Bowls, and are battered to shit.. going into a fresh org with warm ass weather in Florida might sound a lot more fun.
fo4a0ph	1587500752	Texans	nfl	They just lost a ton of trade value for Howard with the Gronk news. So unlikely.
fo4a0q9	1587500753	Patriots	team	Be grateful they got anything at all.GRONK could have filed for reinstatement, which would have fed up the Pats cap.
fo4a0tn	1587500754	Patriots	nfl	I dont know how to feel about this
fo4a0uw	1587500754	Buccaneers	team	Get a new RB
fo4a0x4	1587500755	Falcons	nfl	No they already announced its a 4th rounder
fo4a0yc	1587500756	Buccaneers	team	FIRE THE CANNONS BOYS
fo4a101	1587500756	Patriots	team	Hes been retired for a year and was often injured before he retired, idk howd youd expect more.
fo4a11k	1587500757	Giants	nfl	We dont know how the league values OJ Howard but if you think hed only fetch a trade up from a 7th to a 4th then youre out of your mind
fo4a14x	1587500758	Seahawks	nfl	Which conference is Earl Thomas in again?  Okay, Ill take the other one.
fo4a19d	1587500760	Packers	nfl	Ok go say this shit right now in the Texans sub and see how many people agree with you. Hint none.
fo4a1b0	1587500761	Patriots	team	Hey,My apologies.super upset over all of this. My reply came out way more aggressive than I intended.
fo4a1dq	1587500762	49ers	nfl	Rapoport Free Agent WR Kelvin Benjamin has, in fact, began putting on weight for a return to Golden Corral, sources say. Hes ready. He wants to return. And the chefs want him back for the shrimp, too.
fo4a1ic	1587500763	49ers	nfl	The Bucs are gonna win a ducking Super Bowl
fo4a1ie	1587500764	Jets	nfl	 Theyre your problem now NFC South!
fo4a0ww	1587500755	Lions	team	Sounds like a smokescreen to try and convince the chargers to not trade up and draft Tua because hell fall to that position anyways
fo4a0yj	1587500756	Seahawks	nfl	lol wat
fo4a10v	1587500757	Packers	nfl	Packers, please... OJ would be dope
fo4a1hc	1587500763	Buccaneers	nfl	I dont get it..lol. I guess I was off though...it was a 4th, not a 5th although we did get the 7th.
fo4a1jw	1587500764	Dolphins	nfl	Im surprised Malik doesnt hold more of a grudge against Craig, then...
fo4a1gy	1587500763	Packers	nfl	How is it that coworkers who Ive worked with for YEARS still manage to butcher the spelling of my name? Especially when theyre replying to an email of mine, where they can see my name clearly spelled out several times. Jesus fuck its not hard to spell
fo4a1ol	1587500766	Browns	nfl	Maybe. But hes 31, hasnt played in a year, I cant imagine him playing much more than being put in certain situations, like maybe goal line and third down plays.
fo4a1tp	1587500768	Patriots	team	what the fuck? a 4th?
fo4a1yt	1587500770	Panthers	nfl	You know what?  Fuck it, I want to see it. Were rubbish right now anyway, and if were truly tanking, this will help. Lets go Team Chaos!
fo4a1zp	1587500770	Seahawks	nfl	He was a top 3 TE when he last played. Ill give you this one but I think its fair to assume.
fo4a1zx	1587500770	Patriots	team	Plus we had zero leverage. He is doing just fine in retirement and is only willing to go to one team.
fo4a207	1587500770	Eagles	nfl	Call it a dream team if you wanna
fo4a23e	1587500771	Buccaneers	team	New uniforms, Tom freakin Brady and now the Gronk himself. Also one of the best front 7 in the league. The best duo WR out there right now. 2 young stud CB. Back to back absolute hits on 1st round draft picks. This is not the Bucs life I am used to. But damn am I ready for it.
fo4a25v	1587500772	Rams	nfl	Yeah but who knows what the season is going to look like. If you have a chance to get another weapon for Brady that he already knows, you do it because you dont know if there will be a training camp or a 16 game season.
fo4a1hj	1587500763	Bears	team	So you keep the GM that made you both cap strapped and without traceable assets?Curious way to describe Pace Deserving another year.
fo4a1mz	1587500765	Buccaneers	team	And the best
fo4a1py	1587500766	Eagles	nfl	97
fo4a1to	1587500768	Patriots	team	Fuck are we doing with 0 TEs
fo4a1tx	1587500768	49ers	nfl	Like I said, they on dust. Someone said a 2nd AND OJ Howard LMAO
fo4a1vm	1587500769	Panthers	nfl	Last year was the first noninteresting year in a long time.
fo4a1vt	1587500769	Lions	nfl	Gronk signed with WWE for like a week and said fuck it I can pull a swerve off in the nfl too
fo4a20b	1587500770	49ers	nfl	On paper if Gronk is still Gronk, sure, but who knows what he is anymore. He was a shell of his former self two years ago, maybe retirement did him some good, but he could also be very meh.
fo4a23a	1587500771	49ers	nfl	Anddd hes a Buc.
fo4a23k	1587500771	Bills	nfl	Im pretty sure being an insufferable ass isnt required to be a Bills fan, but thanks for your input.
fo4a24y	1587500772	Buccaneers	nfl	WE MEME TEAM NOW
fo4a251	1587500772	Falcons	team	Simmons it is
fo4a27r	1587500773	Dolphins	nfl	Breaking news Gronk returns after the NFL stops marijuana suspensions
fo4a29u	1587500774	Falcons	team	I say fuck it and we go all in on getting Okudah
fo4a1s3	1587500767	Falcons	team	Did they really have to trade that 7th
fo4a1t4	1587500768	Saints	nfl	Im trying not to, but with the powers that be I cant help it.
fo4a24w	1587500772	Patriots	team	Gronk had 0 in cap space this year if he stayed retired
fo4a2eg	1587500775	Vikings	nfl	HE BACK
fo4a2gc	1587500776	Jets	nfl	And so it was, the golden pheasant has spoken lol
fo4a2i8	1587500777	Cowboys	nfl	How much FAAB in a dynasty league? Asking for a friend...
fo4a2jo	1587500777	Buccaneers	team	Tfw you sign Gronk to a respectable 2 year deal above the Vet minimum and his arm literally falls off the first play of his return career while being tackled catching a 5 yard hitch
fo4a2p2	1587500779	Colts	nfl	OJ Howard for Fournette. Makes sense to me.
fo4a2q5	1587500780	Patriots	team	I love yall but damn Im hyped. Get to to see Tom and gronk again while were rebuilding, and theyre in the NFC on the chance stidhams the real deal? Whats not to love
fo4a2t8	1587500781	Panthers	team	Yup they swapped a 4th for Gronk and a 7th
fo4a27q	1587500773	Patriots	team	Hes long said that.
fo4a2ct	1587500775	Eagles	team	Not just you. It should be most, actually. But its about projection.
fo4a2ec	1587500775	Patriots	team	Just happened....
fo4a2fh	1587500776	Falcons	team	Its either going to go so fucking well for Tampa, or its going to be a shit show. I really hope theres no bland in between.
fo4a2ge	1587500776	Patriots	nfl	Yup
fo4a2ki	1587500778	Patriots	nfl	Inb4 James White traded to the Bucs
fo4a2ns	1587500779	Giants	nfl	Im trippin but I wouldve swore Gronk retired
fo4a2pb	1587500779	Vikings	nfl	k
fo4a2t5	1587500781	Ravens	team	Im not going to say Madden is a great game but to say it never changes is just wrong... Sometimes they add things they added superstar x factors which are nice.. and sometimes they take features away. Its like a birthday surprise you never know what youll get
fo4a2vo	1587500782	Patriots	team	I cant believe this, they HAVE to trade far up in the draft to give the fan base and the team some sort of excitement
fo4a2m5	1587500778	Patriots	team	Lol what a crap return for a 30 year old AllPro TE
fo4a2yu	1587500783	Buccaneers	team	Man idk about this Gronk makes 10 mil and Im not sure he gives you that production anymore.That said, hes got ready made chemistry with Brady, this allows you to trade Howard to address areas of need, and the presence of Brate means you can protect Gronk a bit.
fo4a2ww	1587500782	Bengals	team	Geno 
fo4a37b	1587500787	Chargers	nfl	Texans trade four 2nd round picks for Howard
fo4a37s	1587500787	Rams	nfl	in the midst of all the darkness, gronk returns
fo4a3em	1587500790	Buccaneers	nfl	Evans and Godwin may not be at the top of the league in yardage purely because of how many weapons the team has.
fo4a3hc	1587500791	Vikings	nfl	HE BACK
fo4a2th	1587500781	Buccaneers	team	Just spitting facts lol
fo4a319	1587500784	Jets	team	This is a bit more accurate(httpstwitter.comallbrightnflstatus1251699267736973312?s21)
fo4a34n	1587500786	Packers	nfl	What a time to be a Bucs fan
fo4a35l	1587500786	Chiefs	team	Damn she taking her job seriously
fo4a3ak	1587500788	49ers	nfl	Yay...
fo4a3ll	1587500792	49ers	nfl	The price is Deshaun Watson. Heres BOBs number, get back to me when its done.
fo4a3nk	1587500793	Patriots	team	How the hell can you say this. He got what he could. Hes the best coach of all time. Trust the process.
fo4a344	1587500785	Packers	nfl	1.23 and Gronk for 1.14 is as silly a proposal as 1.14 and OJ for a top 10 picks.
fo4a374	1587500787	Colts	team	Garth and I go waaay back. We initially disagreed about Grigson as a GM and teamfriendly deals. He has called me out in the past. I just wanted to pin him down about where he actually stood on this issue.
fo4a37d	1587500787	Packers	nfl	Bucs are now the Warriors of the NFL
fo4a3dd	1587500789	Texans	team	keep making excuses for OBrien as all the franchise icons leave and slander the man on the way out. Makes sense!Can OBrien walk on water in your world?
fo4a3gs	1587500791	Buccaneers	team	Definitely not haha. Im ecstatic for a 4th. Knowing Belichick I was expecting a 6th and a 7th rounder next year haha
fo4a3k8	1587500792	Eagles	nfl	Great running back class too
fo4a3c4	1587500789	Colts	nfl	Well fuck my ass and call me Hitler, I hate Tampa Bay now
fo4a3hg	1587500791	Jaguars	team	He does seem very introverted so he is probably loving this
fo4a3kg	1587500792	Titans	nfl	Bill OBrien thinks the Patriots got a steal
fo4a3pt	1587500794	Saints	team	Might as well call them the Tom Bradys Buccaneers.
fo4a40g	1587500798	Redskins	team	Chris Samuels, Champ Bailey, Brad Johnson, LaVar Arrington.  Mixed success in that group, but assuming a world where things went right with them staying healthy and the team actually keeping them, thats actually a pretty good hall of talented players.
fo4a3xe	1587500797	Panthers	team	Arent most of the draft darling QBs typically busts anyways? I could be totally wrong, but it seems like thats the case more often than not.
fo4a3m3	1587500793	Buccaneers	nfl	Not bad, but I think they definitely shouldve gone after either Brate or Howard.
fo4a3vt	1587500796	Falcons	team	Being condescending only works when youre not a blatant fucking moron.
fo4a3yz	1587500798	Patriots	team	Was hoping for more than a 4th, but this is a deep draft, so more picks is still good news, especially with Gronk not coming back to play in Foxboro.
fo4a3za	1587500798	Bills	nfl	Que?
fo4a42q	1587500799	Buccaneers	team	I feel a way. Pissed off.
fo4a49n	1587500802	Browns	team	I believe nothing.
fo4a4e2	1587500804	Buccaneers	team	Bro what lol idk how to feel
fo4a4e7	1587500804	Patriots	nfl	only idiots thought that
fo4a3uh	1587500796	Packers	nfl	k
fo4a3vr	1587500796	Patriots	team	Annnd... as I opened the comments I got the espn notification that Gronk and a 7th round pic were traded to the Bucs for a 4th round pic...
fo4a40b	1587500798	Bears	nfl	Jesus Christ, get a good another RB to pair with Jomes and that team is an absolute problem
fo4a40o	1587500798	Patriots	team	Edelman must be sad right now
fo4a4ma	1587500806	Ravens	team	Dude where you been this was 3 months ago. The ravens ran the ball (designed runs) 9 times with their running backs. Hard to establish run when clearly they never tried.but go off I guess lol
fo4a4pz	1587500808	Patriots	team	FUUUUUUUUUUCK!!! A GALLON OF FUCKING GAS COSTS MORE THAN THE VALUE WE JUST RECEIVED IN TRADING GRONK!! WHAT. THE. FUUUUCK.
fo4a4r0	1587500808	Bills	team	Fuck Rob Gronkowski
fo4a4bv	1587500803	Steelers	nfl	So leveon bell to the bucs via trade?
fo4a4c9	1587500803	Saints	nfl	All of this and they still wont make the playoffs
fo4a4fz	1587500804	Eagles	nfl	Didnt he lose a shit ton of weight?? Hes not actually playing is he?
fo4a4l2	1587500806	Broncos	nfl	Nothing. They run a tight ship. After you win 3 super bowls some people probably just wanna have fun. And Gronk wasnt having fun anymore
fo4a4m6	1587500806	Chargers	nfl	330 comments in 8 minutes
fo4a4nc	1587500807	Patriots	nfl	You are 100 going to get a 2nd for Howard now is my point. We just gave you a gift. You get better for your SB win and a 2nd for a 4th. The 4th is useless to us, anything after the 2nd round is a complete crapshoot. The difference in value between a 4th and 7th is basically nothing
fo4a4nn	1587500807	Cowboys	nfl	Brady and grind both give the middle finger to Mr. Billicheat
fo4a4oc	1587500807	Patriots	nfl	Arians literally fought for him to get drafted and get more playing time, what are you even talking about?
fo4a4q8	1587500808	Patriots	team	Just finish the pain and send Jules to Tampa so he can play with Tom (
fo4a4lc	1587500806	Titans	nfl	Gronk aint gonna pass up an opportunity to party on a pirate ship
fo4a4ne	1587500807	Patriots	team	What the fuck.A 4th for Gronk?
fo4a4nf	1587500807	Lions	nfl	Hot take incoming theyre better with Ronald Jones than trading for Leonard Fournette. Dont have to give up anything, he improved a ton last year, hes dynamic with the ball, doesnt have an extensive injury history, and wont expect a large contract.That said, they should probably draft somebody or sign somebody else.
fo4a4pb	1587500808	Jaguars	team	Cro, youre still 1 in my heart. No other admin has adorable dogs in Josh Allen jerseys.And really, thats how I measure quality
fo4a4pj	1587500808	Jets	team	Brady will never win again without the help of cheating buddy Billacheat.. His cheating days are over...and so goes his rings.
fo4a4rr	1587500809	Falcons	team	No for a 4th. They are getting a 7th back
fo4a4u0	1587500810	Patriots	nfl	HAHAHAHAHAHAHAiwannadie
fo4a4vi	1587500810	49ers	team	we have a stable of running backs. coleman and a pick?
fo4a4xy	1587500811	49ers	team	Might be the quarantine talking but Id wear the shit out of a Big Kick Mitch or Big Hit Mitch shirt
fo4a508	1587500812	Chargers	nfl	quack gang or dont quack
fo4a4us	1587500810	Chiefs	nfl	Hot take Gronk is washed
fo4a59x	1587500816	Patriots	team	Lol youre good! Im really sad too. Absolutely crazy. Im done with 2020 
fo4a5am	1587500816	Patriots	team	Et tu, Gronk?
fo4a5h8	1587500819	Titans	nfl	Were gonna draft the thickest fuckin lineman youve ever seen
fo4a5ji	1587500819	Eagles	team	Nothing against Hooker but it makes more sense to draft a guy with the intention of him becoming McLeods replacement or somebody that can take Mills spot if he gets hurtfalters.
fo4a4xc	1587500811	49ers	team	Are we sure about that?
fo4a4zc	1587500811	Patriots	nfl	Himself!
fo4a51p	1587500812	Buccaneers	team	If there is no football this year and we miss out on this I might just off myself.
fo4a541	1587500813	Dolphins	nfl	The rest of the AFCEast sends their regards.
fo4a54b	1587500813	Bengals	nfl	Wes Welker was their 2nd best receiver, then they had the Corpse of Troy Brown, Donate Stallworth, and Jabar Gaffney, with Ben Watson at TE.
fo4a57w	1587500815	Ravens	nfl	nothing
fo4a58d	1587500815	49ers	nfl	Wonder if Gronk puts on enough weight to be an effective blocker or if he leaves a little weight off to give his knees a breather
fo4a59i	1587500816	Patriots	nfl	People still buy Madden? I used to get it every single year as a kid, I would also get NCAA football, create a player and win a bunch of Heismans and get drafted into Madden. Those games were amazing and so much fun. But then they started feeling weird, like the players dont move the right way even though technology has gotten better. And with all sports games its the same crap every year, just updated rosters.
fo4a5he	1587500819	Broncos	nfl	Or they just draft one of those stud WRs and we get to hear the echos of the absolute stunning amount of wet penises slapping over at ESPN headquarters for an entire season
fo4a5hi	1587500819	Patriots	team	He wasnt on the books being retired.
fo4a5ol	1587500821	Bears	team	ESPN Bears wants Diggs
fo4a5tb	1587500823	Patriots	team	not enough.  fine with sending him he was never playing for pats again but seems like light return, at least get one of their TEs on the roster.  Damn
fo4a5az	1587500816	Patriots	team	Hey Brad,I miss you.A Celtics fan who could really use something to take my mind off of this, like maybe Tatum dunking over that bitch Lebron.
fo4a5bb	1587500816	Lions	nfl	Weird. After how many years?
fo4a5eu	1587500818	Patriots	nfl	Oh wow I forgot all about that
fo4a5ev	1587500818	Patriots	nfl	Whatre you complaining about? This shit is insane.
fo4a5hr	1587500819	Chiefs	nfl	Edelman is about to pay Bill to get traded to the Bucs
fo4a5n3	1587500821	Vikings	team	What these numbers show me is just how sad our history is as a franchise. Nothing against Kirk much to the contrary, I like the guy both as a person and a quarterback. But winning a couple of playoff wins shouldnt be enough to put someone in the top 5 alltime QBs for a franchise.
fo4a5oh	1587500821	Buccaneers	team	I really, really dont want a Gronk that has been off of PEDs for probably over a year now on the team. Hes small and not even close to being in football shape these days. He was a transcendent talent in his day, but had too many injuries and is done. Try to develop OJ and feed Brate. Were good at TE.
fo4a5ro	1587500822	Chiefs	team	Best in the business
fo4a5u6	1587500823	Bears	team	Hes also improved every year on reading defenses.
fo4a63z	1587500827	Jaguars	team	They have one, at most two, years do win this.
fo4a5mj	1587500820	Broncos	team	He wasnt a Bronco he was an inside spy for the Patriots.
fo4a612	1587500826	Patriots	nfl	Should be getting a qb. Brady is old. This is a good class. God help brady if he doesnt have a good o line though.
fo4a65n	1587500828	Saints	team	Sorry, I have to disagree. And this is coming from a Baylor student who is dying to see Denzel Moms go to New Orleans.Just because our defensive staff have DB backgrounds doesnt mean the saints dont need linebackers. Thats just a nonsequitur. LB is a major hole in our roster. The simple fact that you mention about how the last several LBs weve gotten have had injuries reinforces the fact that we need help at the position. With Anzalone and Alonso getting hurt every time they walk on a football field we absolutely have to give Demario Davis some support. Have you considered that we run schemes without many linebackers because we dont have many good ones?Additionally, THE SAINTS TRIED TO GET JAMIE COLLINS. They clearly looking for a highend LB to get our defense to the next level. It absolutely makes sense for them to get one in round 1 and get a developmental WR and maybe a QB in later rounds (thinking maybe Fine from UNT?). Obviously there are free agency options too...
fo4a68j	1587500829	Jets	nfl	Yeah, have fun next season guys
fo4a6am	1587500830	Patriots	nfl	Fuck these look so good
fo4a5m2	1587500820	Eagles	nfl	The worst one
fo4a5r2	1587500822	Ravens	nfl	Wtf
fo4a5rk	1587500822	Patriots	nfl	So... TB doesnt send a 4th round pick for Gronk unless they expect he will come out of retirement, right?
fo4a5sl	1587500823	Ravens	nfl	Whats he even worth? Hes been a major disappointment
fo4a5t2	1587500823	Patriots	team	I think a few of you need to pump the brakes on what you think Gronk is gonna get you in return. Some of you seem to be thinking that Gronk got 10 years younger with all this multiple 1st, 2nd..etc picks that you are dreaming about.
fo4a5ul	1587500823	Buccaneers	nfl	Nothing
fo4a5ur	1587500824	Buccaneers	team	No OJ involved? When the Pats already had a massive hole at the position?
fo4a5v1	1587500824	Patriots	nfl	Gilmore is getting up there in age and we aint contending send him too.
fo4a5w8	1587500824	Raiders	nfl	I am here to trade a 6th and Jason Witten for 1 OJ Howard please
fo4a5y5	1587500825	Falcons	team	Dude, what the fuck.  Even if hes half of what he was in his prime, that offense is stupid good.  EFF..
fo4a5yg	1587500825	Patriots	nfl	Nothing
fo4a5yk	1587500825	Patriots	team	Blows bro!
fo4a5yq	1587500825	Vikings	nfl	
fo4a5yv	1587500825	Buccaneers	team	Get with the times!!!
fo4a6fk	1587500831	Buccaneers	team	If it makes you feel better, we dont hate you guys nearly as much as we hate ATL and the Aints
fo4a5wv	1587500824	Bears	team	If  when Pace is fired Ill be interested in seeing how this subs opinion of him shifts.  Right now there seems to be a cautious optimism   I think people forget that Trubisky was supposed to represent the culmination of Ryan Paces 5 year plan where the team essentially tanked so that he could draft the QBOTF.  To miss on that pick so badly (nevermind the fact you passed up two legit AllPro QBs) is something that should draw the ire of the fanbase since it essentially came at the expense of established vets like Forte, Cutler, and Brandon Marshall to start over for the greater good.
fo4a62g	1587500826	Jets	nfl	I mean, we definitely couldve won with Sam. We were a completely different team with Sam starting instead of Falk.
fo4a62h	1587500827	Chiefs	team	Him and Ryan (from Ryan Goes Rogue on YT) are my favorite Chiefs media to get into at the moment. He does a really good job and genuinely loves the Chiefs. I love that hes living his dream. Have an upvote!
fo4a6nq	1587500834	Patriots	nfl	No shit lol
fo4a68i	1587500829	Buccaneers	team	2020 is a video game and none of you guys can tell me different
fo4a6a0	1587500829	Lions	team	RagnowAnd yeah Im with you. If they have to wait  two years, then wait two years. Lawrence will survive sitting for a year. I really REALLY think were in for another 34 win season this year. This subreddit overrates our own playersteam a lot. We are truly horrendous in a lot of key areas.Sadly none of those areas are Staffords fault. Poor guy deserves a true shot at winning a ring, and he aint getting it with BBQ and Patty.
fo4a6b5	1587500830	Saints	nfl	Idk Gronk doesnt really seem like the fucking around type.
fo4a6hc	1587500832	Raiders	nfl	23M SingleGrowing Midwestern or Southern city, likely a tech hub, software developer making 75kyr. I have no student loans, I inherited a house, I live with 4 roommates that give me an extra 3kmo, I drive a paid off 2001 Honda Accord.Can I afford a 16.99 game on steam?
fo4a6w8	1587500837	Giants	nfl	Now they just need.... uh, everything else.
fo4a6yf	1587500838	Eagles	nfl	Just you. D
fo4a725	1587500839	49ers	nfl	Kenneth Murray hype train conductor!! Lets gooo!!
fo4a73n	1587500840	Jets	team	Both are elite talents but in completely different areas.Jeudy elite route runner that has struggled at times with drops and often catches a bit too much with his bodyLamb lacks nuance in his route running, however, his hands are insane and can make any catch he needs, additionally he excels after the catch compared to Jeudy (not that Jeudy is bad here, Lamb is just elite)The reason I think we often see Lamb over Jeudy for us is because Lambs skill set is incredibly well suited to a young QBs development. Especially behind an OLine with question marks.To put it another way, in our specific case would you rather have a guy that is definitely going to get open, but you have to give him the time to get open and the ball will have to be very well thrown, or a guy that isnt going to separate as well but has a very good chance to catch the ball no matter the coverage or place on the field and will add 8 yards after the catch?
fo4a6ec	1587500831	Falcons	nfl	That was the buttsex
fo4a6jk	1587500833	Buccaneers	nfl	I mean honestly if Hayden Hurst is worth a 2nd, Id think OJ Howard would have similar value.
fo4a6ly	1587500834	Buccaneers	nfl	This is unreal
fo4a6ma	1587500834	49ers	nfl	Brother thats a short bag. Were talking 3.5 here
fo4a6mu	1587500834	Patriots	nfl	Given his age and injury history and the fact that hed already retired, itd make no sense to try and convince him to return. A 4th for a 7th is amazing compensation.
fo4a6ok	1587500835	Dolphins	nfl	he already was considering he was with WWE
fo4a6rq	1587500836	Colts	team	I absolutely agree. It does make sense. You either know or you dont by this point...and if you dont think there is a future...its best to get back what you can. Besides, Ballard was always going to have to be selective in who he keeps...and sacrifices had to be made.
fo4a6sn	1587500836	Packers	nfl	What the fuck lol
fo4a6y5	1587500838	Eagles	nfl	So how long has this been hush hush talked about because they were already shopping Howard
fo4a6z4	1587500838	Packers	nfl	Vince McMahon in shambles again.
fo4a76w	1587500841	Broncos	team	I like them for the most part short of the numbers on the helmet and the bolts on the shoulder pads. Its just a lot of bolts. I think having a bolt on the pants and the helmet is enough and they could leave the jersey clean and simple.
fo4a6sr	1587500836	Bears	nfl	Lol
fo4a6te	1587500837	Vikings	team	Best comparison is 2013  coming off a wildcard season, we traded away a starting receiver and had two 1st round picks in the 20s.  We stayed put at 23  25 and then traded up from our 2nd back into the 1st.  Id suspect we take a similar strategy, stay put at 22  25 and then trade up from 58 if necessary (maybe not all the way into the 1st, but just up somewhere) to make sure we walk away with 3 immediate impact guys at areas of need.
fo4a6yy	1587500838	Patriots	nfl	He doesnt even have to take hits, we saw what he did in 2018 when he was 90 blocker.
fo4a71p	1587500839	Ravens	nfl	Nothing, hes got 6 rings thats enough to cement him as goat.
fo4a723	1587500839	Eagles	team	This would make me very happy. There are like 30 receivers in the draft...I know theyre not all created equal, but hell, Carson made a good receiver out of a damn QB.
fo4a729	1587500839	Patriots	nfl	Sounds good to me. The best QB and one of the best TE to ever play the game and in a different Conference? Cool cool cool.
fo4a79t	1587500842	Saints	nfl	Are you fucking kidding me?
fo4a7lc	1587500847	Buccaneers	team	Honestly Ill take it. Ive followed this team for a very long time. Our years of relevance are far fewer than irrelevance.
fo4a6wq	1587500838	Packers	nfl	I knew exactly which one you thought of.No other receiver makes that catch (other than maybe Mike Evans) because they dont have his jumping ability and size to absorb the hits like that plus the body control.
fo4a6z6	1587500838	Broncos	nfl	2020 is wild
fo4a72d	1587500839	Falcons	team	Read to fast
fo4a75d	1587500841	Patriots	nfl	NothingHes a 43 year old QB on a new team in a new conference.
fo4a75h	1587500841	Vikings	nfl	Fuck it go get Randy Moss
fo4a75x	1587500841	Bills	nfl	Yeah I was expecting a move up for a WR before the Diggs trade happened. Beane is aggressive with the guys he likes (very good thing imo at least so far), so I wouldnt be surprised to see a 2nd or 3rd round move up from us if a guy is slipping
fo4a7e4	1587500844	Packers	nfl	Gronk ready to SMASH some crab legs?
fo4a7g2	1587500845	Giants	nfl	Try and score a lot? Does their secondary still eat the poo poo like early last season?
fo4a7ht	1587500845	Vikings	nfl	Imagine giving up a 4th round pick for a retired player. Tampas GM must always pay sticker price for cars too.
fo4a7lt	1587500847	Eagles	nfl	Soooo TWO HELMETS I didnt think that was official yet
fo4a7n2	1587500847	Buccaneers	team	It dont even matter, we have been irrelevant since 02 this is amazing for us
fo4a7nu	1587500848	Saints	nfl	There are so many players you think they can get tested every week after a game when it is hard for everyday Americans to get tested? Players have lives you think they would play a game and go into self quaranteen right after? It takes a few days to show symptoms and I dont think it is known if or how long it takes to make sure you are not infecting others. Von Miller has it he is probably worried about spreading it to teammates or other players. It just seems rushed.
fo4a7o7	1587500848	Patriots	team	I completely agree.
fo4a7oh	1587500848	Redskins	nfl	What even is reality anymore
fo4a7pq	1587500848	Buccaneers	team	Ive been outta state for over a decade now, but Im happy to hear Mons Venus is still happening!
fo4a7ux	1587500851	Vikings	nfl	Damn I cant believe Gronk is a Buc now
fo4a7we	1587500851	Jets	nfl	Howards worth more than a 4th
fo4a7xn	1587500851	Patriots	team	Until he did.
fo4a72z	1587500840	Patriots	nfl	But what if that 7th was gonna be the next Brady?????
fo4a7dr	1587500844	Patriots	team	Im not gonna start doubting Belichick now and he didnt have much bargaining since Tampa was the only place Gronk would want to play... but seriously, only a 4th?
fo4a7fw	1587500845	Steelers	nfl	Foxborough bay
fo4a7gf	1587500845	Packers	nfl	So how does a 6th for OJ Howard sound?
fo4a7lv	1587500847	Patriots	team	a 30 year old tight end who came off a full year of not playing with injury problems
fo4a7na	1587500847	Patriots	team	Well I love more bad news, we could have at least got a late 2nd or early 3rd for him.
fo4a7qc	1587500849	Patriots	team	Some people just think with their hearts. Hearts have business in football deals
fo4a7up	1587500850	Chargers	team	The model looks so weird, I wanna see what these look like on Eckler or Derwin
fo4a7wk	1587500851	Dolphins	nfl	The Panthers picked a bad year to tank
fo4a7zd	1587500852	49ers	team	I cant keep up anymore...Ive seen so many people here say Ruggs is Shannys 1 WR the last few days even if Lamb and Jeudy are on the board still, and now nobody has Ruggs as one of these six?  I agree Jeudy is not on this list though, and I still think Lamb is the most coveted WR but no chance he falls to us.Agree with others that the fact they specified that there are six worth taking at 13 (and presuming that means no QBs) means they are taking adding a defensive player at 13 far more seriously than the chorus of people saying it has to be a WR.
fo4a821	1587500853	Patriots	team	More cap space?
fo4a8em	1587500858	Chargers	nfl	I understand letting a stranger keep the cash if they return your wallet but someone you know? that just seems odd to me
fo4a8fj	1587500858	Patriots	team	FUUUUUUUUUUYYYUYYCK!!
fo4a7r3	1587500849	Broncos	nfl	Damn. That is fire. 
fo4a7vf	1587500851	Patriots	nfl	Because a 4th is basically worthless, thats how its not worth it. Maybe hed change his mind if he has to sit another year or two. This is a literal fucking gift to TB
fo4a7vx	1587500851	Titans	nfl	Enjoy watching the Jets
fo4a7xo	1587500851	Browns	nfl	The bad man cant hurt you anymore
fo4a7zl	1587500852	Patriots	nfl	Its Brady not Braddy
fo4a81a	1587500853	Buccaneers	team	Bucs fans are now immune from pats fans being annoying
fo4a81b	1587500853	Patriots	nfl	Cue meme of Homer slinking back in a Pats jersey and emerging in a Bucs jersey!
fo4a83b	1587500854	Seahawks	nfl	Sign Devonta Freeman or Carlos Hyde for cheap plus a draft pick on a receiving back.
fo4a85n	1587500855	Bears	nfl	Lol
fo4a86u	1587500855	Buccaneers	team	This is fitting, considering the number of people from New England that move to Florida at the end of their careers. Cant wait for your season!
fo4a88t	1587500856	Buccaneers	nfl	Same thing people were saying about Brady to Tampa
fo4a89a	1587500856	Buccaneers	team	You guys not getting Derrick Brown or Isaiah Simmons will be the cherry on top. But I have a feeling you will end up with one of them.
fo4a8an	1587500856	Broncos	nfl	The best offseason gets better
fo4a8ho	1587500859	Patriots	nfl	i dont think Howard makes sense for something for the Pats to want. You gotta pay him next year after he probably sucks again? Ill take the 4th round pick and have a cheap player that hopefully contributes for 4 years
fo4a8lc	1587500860	Buccaneers	team	Source?
fo4a80w	1587500853	Bengals	nfl	If honestly rather have the 4th round pick.
fo4a818	1587500853	Giants	team	Its Burrow then a drop to Tua due to his injury history.  Then it slides a bit to Love who has the arm and legs but not much else.  Then it falls off a cliff to everyone else.  I certainly hope some team is dumb enough to think Herbert is worth trading up for.  But I wont be shocked if they dont
fo4a8gp	1587500859	Dolphins	nfl	West Welker and Donte Stallworth.
fo4a8jg	1587500860	Redskins	nfl	Another report says a 4th rounder to the Pats and 7th founder to the Bucs and the Bucs get Gronk (pending physical). Seems like an overpay for the Bucs but its pretty damn clear theyre going absolutely all in this year with Brady and now Gronk.
fo4a8lp	1587500861	Broncos	nfl	Damn. That is fire. 
fo4a8ms	1587500861	Steelers	nfl	I was under the impression, pre BA, that they werent changing their offense up to suit Brady and that he wanted to come in and learn a whole new system and contribute that way? Admittedly I havent kept up on the situation but that was the last I remember hearing and that this shocked a few people who were expecting the Bucs to rework everything to make it as simple as possible on Brady.
fo4a8ox	1587500862	Giants	nfl	Thats debatable. And is more likely that ruggs is a top deep threat than queen or murray being a stud lb. Also is easier to find stud LBs than 4.28 receivers.I value offense more than defense so yes I would upgrade LT. But that is not a good analogy because the chiefs have Ty hill, mecole and sammy watkins not ty hill, JJ and odell.I understand that but a dblb doesnt mitigate an off game man.Let me give you an example. 2018 chiefs defense was way worse than 2019 chiefs defense. What do you think it was the bigger reason, scheme or personnel change?
fo4a85r	1587500855	Falcons	nfl	Tampa 1st  Tampa 2nd  OJ HowardforJacksonville 1st  Leonard Fournette
fo4a8fd	1587500858	Vikings	team	Its a shame, especially because he had an opportunity to pick up those skills from guys like Thielen and Diggs.
fo4a8jl	1587500860	Redskins	team	He was hurt thats why he retired and hes had a year off. Hes not hurt right now. Concussions werent the problem either.
fo4a8k5	1587500860	Saints	nfl	Fake fan
fo4a8oh	1587500862	Jets	team	Thats my GEQBUS!
fo4a8oj	1587500862	Broncos	nfl	Hes just not the same player he was as he was in his prime. As the super bowl showed he could still bring it just not all that much.
fo4a8sh	1587500863	Falcons	team	We definitely need a defensive stud now Simmons, Young, or Okudah
fo4a8xh	1587500865	Titans	nfl	Guess Im wrong lol ill eat the crow.I wonder if hes still gonna appear in WWE he had potential
fo4a8yt	1587500865	Patriots	team	OJ Howard? Cameron Brate? Literally anything of actual value?
fo4a8i3	1587500859	Packers	nfl	Gronkowski playing in the highest strip clubs b per capital city on Earth. What could go wrong?
fo4a8kv	1587500860	Lions	nfl	I dont think he was worth that much prior to Gronk.
fo4a8m3	1587500861	Falcons	nfl	Stop rebuilding the Patriots in the South dammit. At this point Im just expecting Belichick to get traded to TB in the draft.
fo4a8pn	1587500862	Packers	nfl	Kill me now. At least we have the shutdown to waste more of their primes. Then again, thats more of Rodgers prime. Nvm kill me now.
fo4a8ss	1587500863	Patriots	team	We were under no obligation to trade him. Why did we have to attach a pick lol? Maybe if we were getting OJ Howard back but just for a fourth? Im disappointed.
fo4a8sz	1587500863	Cowboys	nfl	In a row?
fo4a8tl	1587500863	Texans	nfl	Only wanting to play with Brady? How not?
fo4a8wk	1587500864	Saints	team	they really doing the most just to go 88
fo4a93q	1587500867	Steelers	nfl	They have more uniforms than fans in the stadium
fo4a96c	1587500868	Patriots	team	They didnt, really.All GRONK would have had to do is request reinstatement and his 10M salary would have hit the cap (it wasnt on the books as of this morning).
fo4a96h	1587500868	Falcons	nfl	Yea I dont think its going to work out like everyone seems to believe, unfortunately I cant imagine him staying healthy
fo4a90u	1587500866	Patriots	team	Dumb fucking trade at least give us a 2nd rounder. Bill has covid confirmed
fo4a943	1587500867	Patriots	team	lol people mad at gronk. hes always said he only wants to play with brady and said hed rather retire than get traded. loyalty.
fo4a9aw	1587500870	Patriots	team	Got my hopes up, then stomped on them with a boot. Thanks Gronk.
fo4a9d1	1587500871	Patriots	team	Does this clear up any cap space at all?
fo4a92a	1587500867	Giants	nfl	Its happening
fo4a94r	1587500868	Patriots	team	They still couldve maneuvered the cap to get OJ HowardThats not the reason we didnt get him
fo4a97v	1587500869	Eagles	nfl	Dont forget coach Bruce arians holy shit. Its about to be fucking lit in Tampa
fo4a9bg	1587500870	Cowboys	nfl	And a 42 year old qb who cant get the ball down field
fo4a9ch	1587500871	Packers	nfl	I will take one oj Howard please
fo4a9e0	1587500871	Seahawks	nfl	Not sure if this is a hot take or not but I dont think gronk is going to be very good.
fo4a9ez	1587500872	Bengals	team	Fuck yes is the only correct response.
fo4a9ha	1587500873	Seahawks	team	And 74 is Eligible.
fo4a9id	1587500873	Buccaneers	team	I could definitely see us trading OJ for a better RB.
fo4a9cf	1587500871	Patriots	team	I was really understanding of this whole thing with Tom, but seriously, fuck them. This fucking sucks. Our 20 year HoF QB, our 10 year HoF TE, just bend me over and fuck me raw. Just take fucking Edelman and Slater while youre at it you greedy fucking sluts.
fo4a9d7	1587500871	Eagles	nfl	all the leverage?Gronk can stay retired, and the Bucs know nobody can outbid them.
fo4a9de	1587500871	Cardinals	nfl	Maybe. Hes lost so much weight and was already hammered by injuries.
fo4a9es	1587500872	Patriots	team	Only a 4th..With all the leverage. Damn I never question BB except right now.
fo4a9fd	1587500872	Patriots	team	Yep, he got tired of the all work and no play atmosphere.  I think Tom did too.
fo4a9kv	1587500874	Patriots	team	But you know, we have no incentive to actually trade him either
fo4a9pu	1587500876	Patriots	team	I dont love the trade either but youre jumping the gun on bill
fo4a9vt	1587500878	Bears	nfl	curses are for morons
fo4a9yw	1587500880	Patriots	team	I agree with you that Sanu wasnt worth a second. A third probably. But remember the Patriots were coasting with a very good record at the time of the trade and Sanu was believed to be a piece that could help the Pats get another championship. Bill overpaid but Sanu when healthy is a better than average WR on a very good market value contract as well as high character guy young WRs can learn from
fo4a99a	1587500869	Patriots	nfl	You guys gotta hurtle the falcons first.
fo4a9a7	1587500870	Patriots	team	How is it a joke? He got a 4th for a guy who would be retired otherwise
fo4a9b4	1587500870	Bengals	team	Hes not going for less than a second.
fo4a9c4	1587500871	Patriots	team	Excuse me, what the FUCK is going on?
fo4a9l4	1587500874	Chiefs	nfl	Man wtf is your username and flair combo?
fo4a9m7	1587500875	Buccaneers	team	Im just living in some weird reality where I havent left the house in a month and Tom Brady and gronk play for the bucs...
fo4a9n6	1587500875	Giants	team	Never take a Tackle with balance issues
fo4a9nb	1587500875	Cowboys	team	The fact NE had no interest in him mans me think I dont really want him either.  Maybe a 5th.
fo4a9si	1587500877	Seahawks	nfl	graduated high school in 2006 and we broke up in 2008 so 12?
fo4a9sk	1587500877	Buccaneers	team	But can he stay healthy?
fo4a9t6	1587500877	Patriots	team	If Gronk balls this year, Im going to start smoking weed
fo4a9tq	1587500877	Bears	nfl	I guess thats more likely to happen when youre loaded. Oh, that old TE?? Im not using it, You can go ahead and take it, just throw me a nice pick and its yours.
fo4a9w6	1587500878	Patriots	team	Im done with this fucking offseason
fo4aa46	1587500882	Patriots	nfl	Gronk was bar none the best TE of the last decade and has an argument for GOAT at his position. Lynch is a guy who is hoping he gets in. Lynch has 1 first team All Pro and 1 2nd team all Pro for his career and would be lucky to make the Hall
fo4a9v0	1587500878	Redskins	nfl	Is this real life?
fo4a9w8	1587500878	Redskins	team	Trent has just as extensive of an injury history as Gronk. Plus he had a tumor on his head. Plus he is trying to force his way off the team. Plus Ron has said (and acted on the fact that) he wants to build a new culture and get rid of anyone who doesnt buy in. We have no leverage.
fo4a9zi	1587500880	49ers	team	Harrison Bryant TE
fo4a9zw	1587500880	Seahawks	nfl	I wish I knew how long to set a reminder for in this situation 
fo4aa2o	1587500881	Lions	team	Try to find you an untanned leather shoe, cut it up and put it in something. Thats all I got. Maybe fry it?
fo4aa74	1587500883	Patriots	nfl	Unironically seeing people on twitter saying OJ Howard and a 2nd offer would be terrible and Belichick wouldnt do it, why cant these dipshits understand leverage.
fo4aa7e	1587500883	Jets	nfl	Two of those in the AFCCG though.
fo4aa9f	1587500883	Patriots	team	Was this all planned by Brady andor Gronkowksi (not that there would be anything wrong with players doing so since they get fucked by the teamleague at nearly every turn) or did this just play out really quickly?
fo4aac1	1587500884	49ers	nfl	Gronk Exotic
fo4aacs	1587500885	Cardinals	nfl	And Tua runs around a bit too. Most QBs are able to run more in college. Im just saying Brees makespre sense to me as an NFL comp
fo4aafh	1587500886	Jaguars	nfl	If they land Fournette or draft a good RB its over
fo4aagh	1587500886	Patriots	nfl	doesnt bother most of us as much as you think it does.
fo4aahb	1587500886	Bears	nfl	He couldnt host at Raymond James so he might as well play in it.
fo4aair	1587500887	Patriots	team	ITT People that dont understand that Gronk had the Patriots by the balls if he just felt like unretiring. He would have put us in the red and we could have gotten even less.
fo4aajd	1587500887	Patriots	team	A fucking 4th.A cap dump has never hurt this much.
fo4aajh	1587500887	Steelers	nfl	Didnt Leroy the dog call it over a week ago?
fo4aalf	1587500888	Panthers	team	Luke is a Hurney pick. 2012 was Hurneys last draft before he was fired midseason
fo4aamn	1587500888	Lions	nfl	ALL TIGHT ENDS, NO CBs
fo4aao2	1587500889	Patriots	team	Its not like they are getting prime gronk, and its a 4th for free cuz he didnt want to play for the patriots. He wanted to play for Tom Brady.
fo4aa2n	1587500881	Patriots	nfl	You got stidham Izzo and sanu to worry about !! (
fo4aa3x	1587500881	Redskins	team	This by no means makes OJ Howard expendable to Tampa Bay.  Gronk was a walking infirmary and is about to turn 31.
fo4aa42	1587500882	Vikings	team	It is known
fo4aa5q	1587500882	Patriots	nfl	Not having the rest of the football team is more of a concern than anything with tua specifically
fo4aadz	1587500885	Packers	nfl	How long till Gronk wrestles a gator?
fo4aaga	1587500886	Cardinals	nfl	OJ is great depth if Gronk goes down
fo4aaid	1587500887	Bears	nfl	THE BEACH PARTY IS ON!
fo4aamz	1587500888	Patriots	team	2020, please... No more....
fo4aaq4	1587500890	Bills	nfl	That greatest coach in the world barely had his hand in calling the offense most of Bradys tenure, Arians has coached Big Ben, Andrew Luck, Carson Palmer and Jamies Winston,  all different styles of QB that he never changed his offense once to cater. Youre seriously delusional lol
fo4aat7	1587500891	Falcons	nfl	Thats 6 spots though. Jamal was drafted at 6. To move to 6 or get value the jets want would be WAY more then moving up a few spots for Henderson. And to move up to even get Henderson would gut our draft capital for rounds 13. We have SOME capital just not enough to justify a Jamal trade.
fo4aacm	1587500885	Bears	team	I feel like any capable college qb could win at Alabama  Oklahoma
fo4aahe	1587500886	Lions	team	3 for 5 and 26Okudah at 5
fo4aaki	1587500887	Eagles	nfl	I love DJ but that tweet was fairytale christmasland stuff for the patriots
fo4aamt	1587500888	Panthers	nfl	Welker was there. Young Juan Edelman. I think dieon branch as well
fo4aat5	1587500891	Panthers	nfl	I was at least hoping Tampa would make a really dumb trade for him. Nope, Gronk and a 7th for their 4th.
fo4ab08	1587500893	Cowboys	nfl	Brady and Gronk give the middle finger to Mr. Billicheat!
fo4ab0m	1587500894	Patriots	nfl	Gronk always was Florida man
fo4ab76	1587500896	Panthers	team	Hurney definitely drafted Luke in April 2012.  Hurney was fired October 2012.
fo4ab9k	1587500897	Patriots	team	Lol  that guy who called me fucking delusional
fo4aamj	1587500888	Chiefs	nfl	Desaun would join us too if BOB didnt set his curfew to 5 pm.
fo4aapj	1587500889	49ers	nfl	Drafting a RB, 2nd round. I smell it
fo4aaq1	1587500890	Patriots	team	My only counter would be that Gronk lost a TON of muscle mass and if he was planning this out he probably would have been training hard this whole time.
fo4aaqf	1587500890	Steelers	nfl	He achieved GREATNESS
fo4aaqn	1587500890	Colts	team	Yup, my thoughts exactly. Id be down to send a 4th for OJ.
fo4aar0	1587500890	Patriots	team	Why are you guys upset by this? Brady wasnt happy in New England and Gronk was hurt and only wants to play with Brady. So what?!  Are you telling me you dont want Brady to win more rings and even further cement his GOAT status?!   Im all for another BradyGronk ring. It would be amazing
fo4aas8	1587500890	Patriots	nfl	And he cured his CTE!
fo4aawg	1587500892	Bears	team	This is why I want mitch to start. 1, he gets one more shot. Anything like the first packers game last year and hes done. 2, foles has literally seen the best success out of anyone, except maybe tom brady I dunno he hasnt really done much, coming out of a backup roll
fo4aayd	1587500893	Giants	nfl	me 
fo4aayn	1587500893	Cardinals	nfl	I hate Brady but nothing
fo4aazs	1587500893	Jets	team	or a stud wr. Either way, good news for him
fo4ab05	1587500893	Falcons	nfl	Brady is 42 with no o line and gronk is injury prone? Am I doing this right?
fo4ab5r	1587500896	Patriots	team	Lol youre a bozo
fo4ab7f	1587500896	Eagles	team	Are you Howies wife?
fo4ab7w	1587500896	Patriots	team	They have two solid tight ends, we couldnt get 1? Are you fucking kidding me?
fo4ab4g	1587500895	Patriots	team	We also let the greatest QB of all time walk away.
fo4ab5x	1587500896	Giants	nfl	If your GM is making draft moves based on a 31 year old TE unretiring for a year to play with a 43 year old QB then you probably need a new GM
fo4ab8v	1587500897	Eagles	team	Hes on a one year deal. Banking on anything without a backup plan is a quick way to having Macho Harris at FS again.
fo4ab9m	1587500897	Patriots	nfl	True theyre fire
fo4ablb	1587500902	Buccaneers	team	This would be the most Bucs thing ever if the season got canceled lol
fo4abo9	1587500903	Packers	nfl	The guy from the Masked Singer joined the NFL? Crazy
fo4ab35	1587500895	Patriots	nfl	Please just dump me in a tub of acid and get it over with
fo4abj2	1587500901	Packers	team	The deal has already been done.
fo4ablt	1587500902	Bears	nfl	Tom Brady  I AM THE SENATE!
fo4ablv	1587500902	Patriots	team	4th  2 of our thirds  our first to go up to the Giants pick?
fo4abmt	1587500902	Patriots	team	Right.What is your point here?We arent trading our current tight ends..and if he doesnt play with brady..he wont..hear me out..unretire.So, we dont have a ton of wiggle room. His retiring antics also dont increase his trade value, they actually decrease them.Gronks value was not as high as it was in 2014 or 2017, especially when he had a very off final year in New England.
fo4abtt	1587500905	Patriots	team	Just fucking kill me already, fuck those traitors.
fo4abx4	1587500906	Steelers	nfl	Trade for Kamara?
fo4abgq	1587500900	Falcons	nfl	Tampa Bay is public enemy number one for this season.
fo4abiv	1587500901	Jets	team	I feel like Thomas was rated very highly throughout the season, then his stock dropped for no reason, and now everyone is saying hes going to go higher than expected.
fo4abkd	1587500901	Bears	nfl	So this makes one of OJ or Brate expendable. Wonder what happens with either of them. Looking at you, Ryan Pace.
fo4ablc	1587500902	Jaguars	nfl	I mean... Id take him on the Jags for a 5th..
fo4abld	1587500902	Dolphins	team	I think this is closer to the mark than anyone wants to believe. In some hell, we draft Herbert and Chargers take Love..... the Pats could move up to get Tua.  Or if the chargers dont take Tua and and he falls they move up. There are enough scenarios here where I can see myself screaming Mother Fuc!r
fo4abm8	1587500902	Buccaneers	nfl	I dont want to get rid of OJ if Gronk gets hurt we could get fucked and Im fine staying where we are in the draft.
fo4abw8	1587500906	Seahawks	nfl	2020 is wild
fo4abzk	1587500907	Patriots	team	If you dont care about the offensive line, anyway.
fo4ac07	1587500907	Panthers	nfl	Let me out
fo4ac3j	1587500908	Titans	team	How well did Chubb run in the playoffs OH WAIT
fo4ac57	1587500909	Giants	nfl	Oh, hes probably gonna be seen, but not wrestle much.
fo4abf7	1587500899	Jets	nfl	Tompa Bay looking spooky
fo4abk4	1587500901	Dolphins	nfl	Wes Welker and Donte Stallworth.
fo4abp5	1587500903	Seahawks	nfl	I demand to see the pirate ship fire a cannon ball for Gronk to catch mid air for the ultimate power smash
fo4abp7	1587500903	Patriots	team	Whats it do for us with the cap?
fo4abqe	1587500903	Buccaneers	nfl	Id keep him over Brate. See if anyone bites on either but theyre still in a good spot to grab one of the big 4.
fo4abt8	1587500905	Buccaneers	team	Fine Ill buy another jersey. Pewter or Red? Creamsicle gronk would be so sexy though
fo4abv9	1587500905	Patriots	nfl	Well Thuney is the more valuable piece there and hes not in the actual trade. But yeah thats awfully generous.
fo4ac50	1587500909	Vikings	nfl	Bucs fans do you think youre in real life right now? Wow
fo4aca4	1587500911	Saints	nfl	Yes
fo4acca	1587500912	Chargers	nfl	The majority of draft experts had us taking Buckner or Ronnie Stanley. Bosa wasnt seen as a scheme fit by draft experts because we ran a 34 defense at the time. It was a bit of a surprise
fo4acci	1587500912	Panthers	nfl	I just looked.Cam Newton would be the franchise leader in rushing TDs on 9 NFL teams. Hes in 1st or 2nd place on the majority of teams, and never lower than 3rd. Hed be 3rd on the Cowboys alltime list, only behind Hall of Fame runnningbacks Emmitt Smith and Tony Dorsett.
fo4accm	1587500912	Steelers	nfl	Watch  all this shit goes down and then the season gets cancelled. BradyGronk retires. BB reaps the benefit and goes on to torture the league until he dies. On the 7th of never.
fo4accw	1587500912	Patriots	nfl	If he puts on all the weight he lost
fo4abuj	1587500905	Falcons	team	I see what you mean. I ignorantly want him to be the pick solely because of his athleticism and potential. Hes a boom or bust product whose worth the risk of trading up for. He may not fill a team need, but hes the best player on the board not named Joe Burrow or Chase Young. Im assuming you would prefer for them to draft Derrick Brown or Javon Kinlaw correct?
fo4abv5	1587500905	Bills	nfl	Bill Belichick has agreed to coach the Buccaneers
fo4abvy	1587500906	Texans	nfl	Theyve had a few if I recall.
fo4abz3	1587500907	Patriots	team	Im sorry but Gronk is probably still the best TE in the league. I bet the one year off helped a ton with his injuries too.
fo4ac41	1587500909	Ravens	nfl	Breaking Bucs send 5th rounder to Brooklyn for new starting Center, Deandre Jordan.
fo4acdb	1587500912	Buccaneers	team	httpstwitter.comadamschefterstatus1252693001450782721?s21
fo4acex	1587500913	Texans	team	Man, dont start crying because the facts arent lining up with your opinion.
fo4acg3	1587500913	Patriots	team	Haha fuck you
fo4acqw	1587500917	Bears	team	I disagree, I think Pace is going for the first first time in history to be comprised entirely of QBs and TEs.
fo4ac7j	1587500910	Saints	nfl	oh my fucking god
fo4ac9g	1587500911	Vikings	team	If we keep our 25 pick, what are we using to get up into the top 1015?  Our 22 wont be nearly enough.
fo4ac9p	1587500911	Patriots	team	idk about their iOL, only know they need a tackle.   The problem with sending Gronk AND Thuney to them is they only have 13m(15m if they sent us Howard) in cap space which is basically Gronk and their rookie class so theyd need to move stuff around to make it all fit, though its far from impossible.
fo4acjl	1587500915	Patriots	team	Me too... and I live here lol
fo4ack1	1587500915	Buccaneers	team	Get Brady his 7th and 8th. I know they may trade Howard, but think 5 wide Evans, Godwin, Gronk, Howard, and Brate. Good luck.
fo4acnl	1587500916	Chiefs	nfl	Im deathly afraid they will draft my draft crush Clyde EdwardsHelaire (
fo4acsq	1587500918	Patriots	team	A 4th is amazing value for a guy who was never gonna be in a Pats uniform again. Literally turning nothing into something.
fo4acvf	1587500919	Patriots	team	no one has fun playing with belichick at the end of their career.
fo4acxz	1587500920	Patriots	nfl	The pats not being good wont make the jets good.
fo4acn9	1587500916	Eagles	team	Just have to hope McLeod doesnt play like his 2019 self
fo4acs2	1587500918	Buccaneers	team	I was first (httpswww.reddit.comrbuccaneerscommentsfm5nihweshouldgofullstupidandbringthismanout?utmsourceshareutmmediumiosapputmnameiossmf)
fo4act9	1587500918	Patriots	team	A retired TE who wouldnt play here and could easily have become a FA with not even a comp pick in return.
fo4ad29	1587500921	Steelers	nfl	STUDham is already the next Brady
fo4acjm	1587500915	Jets	team	Takes 2 my friend
fo4acrq	1587500918	Chargers	nfl	What happened to Gronk23 for 14???
fo4ad2r	1587500922	Raiders	nfl	I rooted for him with the Titans, he was too likable to dislike. Im convinced something about that fibula injury messed with his head. He never really seemed the same after that.
fo4ader	1587500926	Ravens	nfl	BAH GAWD, THATS GRONKS MUSIC
fo4adf6	1587500926	Patriots	team	Baytriots
fo4adgm	1587500927	Jets	team	She hosts a radio show out of Philly. This is such an obvious smokescreen lol
fo4adhb	1587500927	Patriots	nfl	Im more upset about this than I probably should be
fo4acyr	1587500920	49ers	nfl	people have no sense of humor.
fo4ad1e	1587500921	Patriots	team	Not getting one of their 3, I am sure.
fo4ad2u	1587500922	Buccaneers	team	His last year with the pats he looked like his joints were being held together by fishing line and chewing gum.
fo4ad7t	1587500923	Patriots	team	For real.First mookie now all of this?Hope you and your loved ones are staying safe 3.
fo4addy	1587500926	Browns	nfl	Blessed be the Yates list
fo4ad4n	1587500922	Buccaneers	nfl	Get rid of OJ. Brate is the better TE
fo4adhe	1587500927	Jets	nfl	Sounds like collusion to me. Brady bringing the cheating to Tampa
fo4adk1	1587500928	Panthers	nfl	We arent dormant we have Teddy!Fucking shoot me
fo4adl8	1587500929	Panthers	nfl	us first
fo4adm7	1587500929	Chargers	nfl	Yeah either him or Stanley, but people were deadset on us taking one of them. Telesco said that Bosa was their top prospect all throughout the college season and leading up to the draft process so theres that. I read in an article some where that a GM believed Tom is the hardest read in the NFL. Makes sense though because almost nothing comes out of the front office.
fo4adna	1587500929	Steelers	nfl	Pls credit Leroy first on the scoop.
fo4adc8	1587500925	Falcons	team	Exactly and they didnt even have to trade OJ Howard
fo4adf7	1587500926	Bills	team	Should Buffalo go for OJ Howard?
fo4adff	1587500926	Patriots	nfl	Pats got a draft pick out of it, and we get to watch Brady throw to Gronk again. Will be fun as shit to watch even if its not in New England
fo4adga	1587500927	Buccaneers	team	2020 is a mad year huh Bucs fans?
fo4adjm	1587500928	Raiders	nfl	Right, I feel like the domino effect of the AB situation could be a lot more dangerous for the league than most seem to realize. If AB got told to STFU and ride the bench Im not sure we see Ramsey and Ngakoue pulling the same stunt immediately after. Whats to stop the next star player from taking their ball and going home until they get to play where they want.
fo4adj5	1587500928	Patriots	team	Pats couldnt do better than a 4th for the best TE of all time thats had a year to rest and get healthy?!
fo4adk6	1587500928	Patriots	team	I dont think Gronk even comes back if Brady had stayed on the Pats. Ugh, Brady sells himself to Tampa to get out of NE and now Gronk instantly unretires to play in TB.
fo4adlb	1587500929	Rams	nfl	true, but would you say the same if the Jags got rid of Yannick for a 4th?Gronks value is higher than a 4th. But if he said he was only willing to agree to a trade to the Bucs, then the Bucs get to choose the price. I think the Bucs win this trade.
fo4adoj	1587500930	49ers	nfl	Wow, I didnt think Gronk would return. I knew he might come back if the CBA eased up on the weed restriction, but I still assumed it was pretty slim
fo4adp5	1587500930	Buccaneers	team	I cant imagine how fucking happy you guys all are with everything that is happening with your favorite team. I love it.
fo4adpk	1587500930	Patriots	team	I mean thats what Im doing. Im all for TB now....Until TB  Gronk leaves P
fo4adpl	1587500930	Seahawks	nfl	Dude has shed a ton of mass...better get that fight milk going, pronto
fo4ads5	1587500931	Cowboys	nfl	You never log off Reddit lol
fo4adwc	1587500933	Bears	nfl	GRONK DOES
fo4adww	1587500933	Packers	team	lol Tampa stock piling the nukes
fo4adzy	1587500934	Patriots	nfl	No it isnt, a 4th and a 7th are the same thing, a complete crapshoot for a player that is almost guaranteed to be less than a backup
fo4ae0d	1587500934	Vikings	team	Its not bad footwork though, its just the style of drops that they use at Iowa (and given their history with NFL OL, Im willing to bet they know what theyre doing haha)
fo4ae5l	1587500937	Patriots	nfl	Oh shit! First offseason news that actually has me hyped!
fo4ae8k	1587500938	Colts	team	I love Eason. Huge arm and great physical ability. A year or two behind such an experienced vet to learn the ins and outs of the league and I think he could do great things
fo4ae0v	1587500935	Patriots	team	Good for both sides, but I still feel empty
fo4ae2c	1587500935	Packers	team	I was there too and can testify the wind was horrible. Me and my family spent the weekend in DC it was like that the whole time. Im not sure Ive ever seen wind that bad lol
fo4aeew	1587500940	Eagles	nfl	Rob is willing to follow Tom to the ends of the Earth, even if he must become a F L O R I D A M A N
fo4aeg4	1587500940	Browns	nfl	Deon seems a bit old and expensive at this point. I think the Bucs have Oline concerns more than corner.
fo4adyg	1587500934	Patriots	nfl	Well he wasnt going to play for anyone other than Brady and I love watching Gronk
fo4ae12	1587500935	Seahawks	team	AHHH SHIT ITS 2019 offseason modeLets trade for OJ HOWARD BABBBYYY
fo4ae2t	1587500935	Saints	nfl	Uh wes welker?
fo4aej4	1587500942	Buccaneers	team	Were all in a weird fucking dream, arent we?
fo4aehc	1587500941	Patriots	team	Just a cap dump for a player that wouldnt have played in NE anyway... still hurts tho (
fo4aelc	1587500942	Patriots	team	For real.
fo4aelt	1587500943	Patriots	team	At this point Im down to trade Jules too. Get the whole gang together down there if we can get some value and just punt on this season. Hes going to miserable up here anyway, might as well get ahead of it
fo4aer5	1587500945	Patriots	team	As someone who just moved to Sarasota, this has been an interesting offseason.
fo4aeuu	1587500946	Patriots	nfl	Its going to be super awkward if they dont make the playoffs
fo4aez9	1587500948	Seahawks	nfl	Lol and just now they are saying hes actually already done the physical. Its a done deal.
fo4ae8z	1587500938	Cowboys	team	its probably more that the bucs wanted more for oj, and not that the pats didnt want him
fo4aec3	1587500939	Saints	team	This only solidified the fact that we need to draft a linebacker
fo4aeck	1587500939	Patriots	team	Fuck it. Lets trade Thuney for picks at this point 1st round swap and a 2nd lol
fo4aeee	1587500940	Eagles	team	Billy likes to drink soda.
fo4aeir	1587500942	Patriots	team	Why would the bucs offer one of them? Its not like the patriots could get a better deal anywhere else.It was either Gronk to Tampa or he stays retired.
fo4aejc	1587500942	Patriots	nfl	The 2m counts the set aside money for draft picks.
fo4aejx	1587500942	Bengals	nfl	OJ Howard 
fo4ael3	1587500942	Patriots	nfl	I was starting to get over Brady being gone and this is a real kick in the nuts.
fo4aemn	1587500943	Steelers	nfl	initial thoughts Hes got to put 2030lbs of muscle back on his frameBrate and Howard are already a good catching and blocking set of TEsI bet TB gets the 4th or better for one of those TEs
fo4aenc	1587500943	Bengals	team	I helped you on your way to 10 feedback though!
fo4aend	1587500943	Seahawks	nfl	BoB enters the chat.
fo4aepv	1587500944	Patriots	nfl	I thought wed get a 7th.Gronk has 0 value to us.
fo4aet1	1587500945	Patriots	team	Theyre getting neither of those, lets be real.
fo4aezy	1587500948	Texans	team	I mean do we really need to trade more valuable pieces though, we already have Fells on the team. I mean these are just my thoughts
fo4af0u	1587500948	Ravens	nfl	even better when its not even in the same conference
fo4af22	1587500949	Cardinals	nfl	Please nfl God and God of all things let there be a season this year.
fo4af8r	1587500951	49ers	nfl	Good thing he wont need to pass a weed test
fo4aeim	1587500941	Cardinals	team	I think the mods banned that type of stuff unfortunately
fo4aep2	1587500944	Patriots	team	Youre right. The Pats have been mired in misery for so long, they need to give the fans some excitement. The 16 months since their last Super Bowl win have been an absolute nightmare
fo4aetw	1587500945	Giants	nfl	Thats debatable. And is more likely that ruggs is a top deep threat than queen or murray being a stud lb. Also is easier to find stud LBs than 4.28 receivers.I value offense more than defense so yes I would upgrade LT. But that is not a good analogy because the chiefs have Ty hill, mecole and sammy watkins not ty hill, JJ and odell.I understand that but a dblb doesnt mitigate an off game man.Let me give you an example. 2018 chiefs defense was way worse than 2019 chiefs defense. What do you think it was the bigger reason, scheme or personnel change?
fo4aewa	1587500946	Buccaneers	team	What red flags other than injury concerns? Gronk is the complete package as a tight end, a freak of nature and has a legendary rapport with Brady
fo4aew9	1587500946	Patriots	nfl	This has been the worst offseason in the history of offseasons, possibly ever
fo4aey6	1587500947	Bears	nfl	marcus mariota has entered the chat
fo4aeym	1587500947	Saints	nfl	Washed TE,Washed QB and Average O Line 
fo4af3d	1587500949	Eagles	team	Youre getting downvoted but youre not wrong, ThurmanJenkins are two of the best safeties weve had since Dawkins left and they both converted from cornerback. On top of that these guys being on shortcheap deals is a good thing, we can retain them or move on based on this season rather than locking up 2 unproven guys and an aging vet long term, no?
fo4af5b	1587500950	Lions	nfl	Ha! Next youll be telling me Tupac isnt living in Cuba and JFK wasnt abducted by aliens.
fo4af86	1587500951	Patriots	team	Not going to include Stid.Harris and Winovich
fo4afb5	1587500952	Giants	nfl	But thuney is one of the best interior OL in the league so that trade is fine
fo4afer	1587500954	Patriots	team	I hope the Bucs lose every fucking gameI was fine with Brady leaving but this shit stinks
fo4afgm	1587500954	Patriots	nfl	Gronk has never been healthier
fo4afjv	1587500956	Eagles	nfl	Clyde Edwards Helaire incoming to the Bucs.
fo4afkd	1587500956	Raiders	nfl	Your options are... get something or get nothing.  Kind of like the Seahawks with Lynch, might as well get something for a retired player.
fo4aflt	1587500956	Patriots	team	2020,  this is the last straw
fo4afmm	1587500957	Patriots	team	We all feel betrayed. This is how the Empire topples.
fo4aexs	1587500947	Patriots	team	Funny, nothing is what we have at TE currently
fo4af29	1587500949	Patriots	nfl	In the biz we call that a reestablishing shot.
fo4af3v	1587500949	Dolphins	team	Gronks bad angle took him back to Florida. Big oof.
fo4af5u	1587500950	Patriots	nfl	We cant handle that level of memery.
fo4af71	1587500951	Buccaneers	nfl	Could beBruh
fo4afeo	1587500954	Ravens	nfl	people really want the patriots to get tua
fo4afj9	1587500955	Saints	nfl	When I said I wanted Brady in the division I DIDNT MEAN LIKE THIS.
fo4afju	1587500956	Buccaneers	nfl	Lol hes still on his rookie contract, aint getting cut anytime soon
fo4afp0	1587500958	Lions	nfl	You need a fullyfunded emergency fund of 1 years salary! And are you maxing out your 401k?After these things are done, you need to start saving up for a house, but one in a really good neighborhood that will retain its value for if you ever need to sell it.
fo4afw3	1587500960	Broncos	nfl	Ugh
fo4afgi	1587500954	Patriots	team	I swear to God if Edelman leaves too Im going to riot.
fo4afm5	1587500956	Patriots	nfl	Well thats obviously not true.
fo4afn1	1587500957	Falcons	nfl	How is that relevant to staying in physical shape during retirement
fo4afu9	1587500960	Patriots	team	We had zero leverage...
fo4afmu	1587500957	Panthers	nfl	Dude what the fuck man. Matt Ryan is the third best QB in this division and now the Bucs have an offense that might beat KC for talent
fo4afoq	1587500957	Patriots	team	Who is giving you a better offer than a 4th round pick?
fo4afqo	1587500958	Buccaneers	team	Oh my god, this is (most likely) really happening
fo4afqv	1587500958	Patriots	team	How? You expect a 1 for a washed gronk that looked old and slow two years ago?
fo4afua	1587500960	Giants	nfl	No I wouldnt, the catch was legendary. Besides that moment, outside of Giant fans and maybe some nfc east fans, no one would know who tyree is. Same thing with romo, if he wasnt on the cowboys nobody would talk about him the same way. Imo Mcnabb is more of a legend than romo is.
fo4afum	1587500960	Eagles	nfl	Saints about to write up a new rule
fo4afxm	1587500961	Patriots	team	Lmao whatever man. Can we now finally move on from these guys? Its clear they both did not want to play in New England anymore. Edelman is next.
fo4ag2w	1587500963	Packers	nfl	Im a fan of Queen, not so much fan of the movie. But gotta say that its far from wasnt watchable. I mean, 900 M box office is a clear indicator that it was watchable at least.Its ok to say you didnt like it.
fo4ag7b	1587500965	Bears	nfl	Honestly expected them to get less
fo4agab	1587500966	Eagles	nfl	Damn, Barry almost got...wait a minute....
fo4agao	1587500966	Bears	nfl	Available tight ends?   Ryan Pace enters the chat
fo4agbu	1587500966	Texans	nfl	No one is saying that.
fo4aggw	1587500968	Giants	nfl	Fuck, we gotta face that this year, dont we?
fo4afup	1587500960	Patriots	team	Who has been retired for year and is riddled with injuries that have sapped a lot of his effectiveness. This is 2020 Gronk, not 2011 Gronk.
fo4ag04	1587500962	Eagles	team	it does seem that we should consider ourselves lucky to have him still there at 21.  i dont see it, unless you want to project how he will do because most of his routes last year were with a linebacker or safety starting 7 yards off the line of scrimmage, with Jefferson running very short routes that involved one turn and look for the ball.  So, yeah project all you want how great he will be but if you want to say he is one of the best prospects in 40 years then also be honest and say you are taking a small sample of his catches and throwing out most of them that tell you little of how good a prospect he is.
fo4ag1m	1587500962	Eagles	nfl	He has no value if he doesnt come back, and he was only coming back if he played with Brady in Tampa
fo4ag45	1587500963	Patriots	team	God I hate our fan base. People calling for Belichick to get fired? Wtf
fo4ag50	1587500964	Patriots	team	You can never get a comp pick for a player you trade away.You also cannot get a comp pick for a player who retires.
fo4ag5k	1587500964	Buccaneers	team	If anything the post seems rather level headed....youre title is a little off
fo4agbe	1587500966	Falcons	nfl	Depends what Bucs offer. If they offer ass I take the chance and call his bluff if its a 67th.And he only wants to play for the Bucs so hed unretire (to force Pats hand). But if the Pats ended up restructing contracts to have room if they want. Hell just collect the money or retire which puts them right where they were.They could call his bluff on the fact that a Te is a young Qbs best friend. Or they could be petty and not wanna help TomGronk since most expect them to not contend.
fo4agbf	1587500966	Packers	nfl	Next week.
fo4agdr	1587500967	Vikings	nfl	Emphasis on hes Tom fucking Brady and hell get what he wants. I dont think the trade is actually indicative of Gronks true value, but more so that the Pats had the leverage in this situation
fo4agh4	1587500968	Eagles	team	I like Aiyuk.  Would probably be available in early 2nd round, but if hes Howies guy, just grab him and go on.
fo4agji	1587500969	Patriots	team	This is literally a free 4th round pick for a 7th round pick. Gronk wasnt coming back dude.Let him go have fun with the GOAT.
fo4agn7	1587500971	Vikings	nfl	bruh you got free picks for a retired player.
fo4agnv	1587500971	Patriots	team	checks which 1st rd pick bucs haveWERE GETTING TUA BOYS.(httpsmedia.giphy.commediaPZYSUDk0ajJnOgiphy.gif)s
fo4agpy	1587500972	Buccaneers	team	Wed better have a fucking season this year.
fo4agnd	1587500971	Lions	team	 why would they even need to to take an OT?
fo4agxh	1587500975	Patriots	nfl	Thats my takeaway from this.  Its going to be weird seeing Brady AND Gronk on the Bucs, but at least we got a 4th for nothing essentially.
fo4ah0n	1587500976	Raiders	nfl	Probably a good thing its not your decision
fo4agg4	1587500968	Giants	team	This will greatly impact the Giants this Thursday.
fo4agix	1587500969	Vikings	nfl	Tampa looking to take the Browns yearly crown of winning the offseason.
fo4agja	1587500969	Patriots	team	This just in. Patriots trade Belichick to Tampa Bay.
fo4agjc	1587500969	Saints	nfl	Pats have already got the best dynasty in football history. Everything else they get in the foreseeable future is basically icing on the cake for their franchise
fo4agku	1587500970	Ravens	nfl	The entire national media has been fantasizing ridiculous shit about how Tua gets to the Pats. Theyre all pissed they lost one of their media darling teams and desperately want them to stay contenders.
fo4agla	1587500970	Buccaneers	nfl	Am I the only one not liking this? I realize that we arent giving up a whole lot, but I liked the HowardBrate duo especially now that we have Brady. Im sure Gronk will come to play but I am concerned about his health holding up
fo4aglm	1587500970	Bills	team	Omg if we had that top three i would cream myself
fo4agrb	1587500972	Broncos	nfl	Theyre going to draft Jonathon Taylor, then theyll have two workhorse RBs to pair with that passing offense.
fo4agrt	1587500972	Patriots	team	Pretty sure nothing.
fo4agsc	1587500972	Bills	nfl	Thats true. I wasnt saying you could afford Adams or anything because honestly Im not sure. Was just curious on your opinion of trading up considering you said you dont have much draft capital
fo4agvz	1587500974	Cowboys	nfl	Yes in 2016.  If we have to start sanchez or some other journeyman qb we absolutely do not go 133.  We probably dont make the playoffs at all.He had a 29tds to 4 ints, 3600 yards and a 8.0 YA.  He was fucking incredible for a rookie and was just one of the better QBs that year.We saw what this team was without Romo the year before.  Just adding Zeke to it doesnt get you 9 more wins.
fo4agxr	1587500975	Panthers	nfl	I would actually love that.
fo4agy7	1587500975	Chargers	team	Just became a fan today.  Love the new look.
fo4agyi	1587500975	Eagles	team	Im saying that Id rather have a stud wr who plays a lot of slot rather than trying to get an outside wr later in the draft. Now Ill openly admit that they know more about these prospects than I could ever hope to. If they really believe that they can get a stud outside wr, then yes I agree with you. But if they like Jefferson better than whoever else is left, then they should take him
fo4ah09	1587500975	Texans	team	We could certainly use another TE on the roster...
fo4ah20	1587500976	Patriots	team	Fuck this shit
fo4ah2n	1587500976	Buccaneers	nfl	Gronk was just traded for a 4th and 7th....Thats how you finish
fo4ah4d	1587500977	Patriots	nfl	This is a bad argument. Despite all of what you said, the Lions probably win if it werent for the bad call.
fo4ah63	1587500978	Dolphins	nfl	Thank Christ this is another divisions problem now.
fo4ah77	1587500978	Buccaneers	team	Alexa, play Let me Clear My Throat by DJ kool
fo4ah8i	1587500978	Falcons	nfl	lmaoooo 2020 just gets crazier and crazier.
fo4ah8p	1587500978	Buccaneers	team	Good thing we dont have to play the Bucs for another 3 years
fo4ah9w	1587500979	Broncos	nfl	Its good that youre sensible like that. But the NE folks in the Jeremiah thread were talkin crazy.
fo4ahee	1587500980	Saints	nfl	I need an adult
fo4agrl	1587500972	Lions	team	Nobody hates him as a person. They just hate that hes the GM, and its hard to disagree considering weve taken 6 or 7 steps back before taking a step forward.
fo4agt2	1587500973	Patriots	team	Lol teenager hot take Not even a good attempt at trolling kid
fo4ah0u	1587500976	Steelers	nfl	Tom Brady, Gronk, and all of my other enemies can do whatever the hell they want in the NFC South, so long as theyre gone by 2022.
fo4ah65	1587500978	Bears	nfl	Yea I dont have any faith that Gronkowski is any closer to his former self than when he retired. Brady has been defying his age for so fucking long, but hes 42, on a new team with a new system. Gonna get the buccs a ring or a top 5 pick.
fo4ah6n	1587500978	Jets	team	I am also 32. Honestly I have no ill will towards the Bills except for recent times. I mentioned in another post that even in 2015 when you knocked us out of the playoffs at 106, I more blamed Rex Ryan than the fan base. I didnt really even hear any trash talk  you beat us soundly AND embarrassed Fitzpatrick.Youre right, I am a bit triggered, and for that Im sorry if I misread your intentions. In recent years though, many fan bases  notably the Browns and Vikings (when they brigaded our sub)  but many others, act like the Jets are the worst team in the history of the NFL. The Bills in particular the past two years have participated in this narrative. And posts like yours comparing them to the Oilers sort of feed that narrative.
fo4ah44	1587500977	Cardinals	nfl	just do it
fo4aho7	1587500984	Rams	team	Ramsey hasnt been here long enough for me to put him on there, Cooks i guess i did but that just says how lucky were have been with WRS. Foles sucked. Hayes i missed
fo4ahq4	1587500985	Bears	team	Id rather have Kyler or Baker instead of Mitch, thats for sure
fo4ah61	1587500977	Ravens	nfl	Gronk and a 7th for a 4th.... oof I gues licht wasnt the stupid one
fo4ah60	1587500978	Lions	team	He seems like a really good pass rusher. Hes been kind of a butthole on Twitter tho
fo4ah8v	1587500978	Patriots	nfl	The chance that Gronk could eventually unretire for us is definitely worth more than a 4th. A 4th is worth extremely little
fo4ah8u	1587500978	Buccaneers	team	This is the most exciting time Ive ever had as a fan. Been a fan since 2007. Not long for most of you, but this is a cool feeling.
fo4ah9d	1587500979	Lions	nfl	I cant even imagine being a bucs fan? How do you take this all in????
fo4ahby	1587500979	Giants	team	The 3 best OTs will not make it to pick 12.
fo4ahlw	1587500983	Vikings	nfl	enjoy being a jets fan
fo4ahp0	1587500984	Cowboys	nfl	Ya Im tired of the Adams talk also. I would rather trade for Hooker assuming the price is right.
fo4ahp9	1587500984	Patriots	team	That happened so fast
fo4ahsn	1587500986	Bengals	nfl	Youre right, however I want to add that the extra year off might actually be a good thing for Gronk in terms of health, comfort, and injury risk
fo4ahtf	1587500986	Colts	nfl	I forgot Freeman was still available. If they dont draft a RB, this would be a good way to go.
fo4ahw4	1587500987	Patriots	team	you mean no one has any incentive to trade anything for gronk? because he wont come out and play unless its the bucs
fo4ahwj	1587500987	Ravens	nfl	Uhhh
fo4ahwy	1587500987	Cowboys	nfl	Bong rips and keg stands at half time.
fo4ahd3	1587500980	Packers	nfl	Arians doesnt use TEs in his schemes. But what about.... TWO TIGHT ENDS!!
fo4ahfz	1587500981	Patriots	team	The fact that Tom is not here should be strike 1, 2, and 3.
fo4ahii	1587500982	Patriots	nfl	Sounds like a dream team
fo4ahkb	1587500983	Eagles	nfl	Fantasy drafts gonna be LIT this year
fo4ahkk	1587500983	Bears	team	Which is a valid argument. But at the same time he won just about every game. Id say it inconclusive at this point.
fo4ahn9	1587500984	Eagles	team	Hahaha, is he giving us the hint not to cheer him on too loudly when he comes back??  Like, does he just want to retain his underdog status? Not gonna happen Nick, youre gonna be greeted like the Pope here for the rest of your life!
fo4ahnl	1587500984	Patriots	nfl	That could legitimately be the best receiving talent ever on one team
fo4ahvd	1587500987	Falcons	nfl	You shut your mouth man.  Please.
fo4ahxa	1587500987	Vikings	nfl	Danielle is elite. Hes good for 1215 sacks from here on out.
fo4ai2z	1587500990	Titans	team	Biggest takeaway is why Metcalf is getting one before A.J.
fo4ai4o	1587500990	Chiefs	nfl	Just ridiculous. It was always gonna go in Tampas favor. The Patriots have a currently retired player on their roster they can cheaply flip for any kind of draft capital in the middle rounds.
fo4ahuf	1587500986	Buccaneers	team	Im fully expecting neither to happen. Tepper and Hurney will try to pull another magical rabbit out of the hat. I havent been totally turned off by the moves like other Panthers fans have, but I literally have no idea what we will look like since everything weve done is a major unknown.
fo4ai3j	1587500990	Patriots	team	Been seeing the number 10mil freed up being thrown around, but Im here asking the same question
fo4ahwn	1587500987	Giants	nfl	Vince McMahon is probably pissed right now.
fo4ahx7	1587500987	Broncos	nfl	All accounts say oj is on his way out
fo4ai88	1587500991	Vikings	nfl	f5 szn is lit
fo4ai91	1587500992	Redskins	team	Time to speak OJ Howard for a 4th (which will be one of the picks we get back in a Trent trade) into existence 
fo4aidw	1587500994	Patriots	nfl	Hurts more than losing Tom, tbh
fo4aihh	1587500995	Patriots	nfl	No then wed have ended up with like Jordan Reed
fo4ahyx	1587500988	Patriots	nfl	Poor Edelman (
fo4ai08	1587500989	Patriots	team	Fuck today. Dead  Co. canceled and now this. So much for being done with football.
fo4ai69	1587500991	Eagles	team	Anybody that boos Foles is leaving the linc in a body bag.
fo4ai7n	1587500991	Patriots	team	That was in defense of Brady to some idiot. Keep making terrible comparisons of Brady and Ray Allen though. Havent seen that far of a reach in a long time.
fo4ai7r	1587500991	Seahawks	nfl	Wtf!??! It actually happened?!?!
fo4ai96	1587500992	49ers	team	Yeah Im pretty sure Engram would have more value than Howard. Howards best season was when he had 565 yards. Plus everyone knows Tampa has 3 TEs now and will likely trade one.
fo4ai9h	1587500992	Chiefs	nfl	I thought this was highly upboted because we were making fun of the chargers for calling themselves the best, turns out its super upboted because they made some sweet looking uniforms.
fo4aib8	1587500993	Panthers	nfl	Hahaha. Im in danger. Our secondary
fo4aibw	1587500993	Browns	nfl	 I 100 think they pass on Tua for an OT.FTFY
fo4aidl	1587500994	Patriots	team	Just take me away already, corona
fo4aidv	1587500994	49ers	nfl	Opposing teams are gonna be so gobsmacked by those sexy uniforms they wont even be comeptitive. Chargers 190 SB Champs confirmed.
fo4aifs	1587500994	Bears	nfl	He didnt look great last year and now they have gronk. Idk how they would use both of them when they barley used oj.
fo4aiks	1587500996	Panthers	nfl	potential is still valuable and they know he has it.
fo4aio5	1587500997	Vikings	nfl	Yooooooooo.......how the fuck they live up to the hype. These the best uniforms in the league.
fo4ai5l	1587500991	Patriots	team	I legit sent this exact meme to my text group as soon as i heard lol
fo4ai7e	1587500991	Buccaneers	team	Sooo worth it
fo4ai8k	1587500992	Lions	team	Trade down to 6, take Kinlaw
fo4ai8u	1587500992	Eagles	nfl	Now do offensive line.
fo4aibo	1587500993	Lions	nfl	Remember, there are a lot of qualifiers to this offense though. Youre banking hard on a 42yearold QB getting comfortable in an offense without the benefits of preseason works, as well as a tight end, who retired because he was broken, coming back down 2030 lbs of muscle. It can be incredible... or it could flop
fo4aien	1587500994	Patriots	team	Im sorry but I think Gronk, especially on a year of rest, could arguably still be the best TE in the league. At least top 3.
fo4aig2	1587500995	Patriots	nfl	Because he fucked his hips up.
fo4aipx	1587500998	Raiders	nfl	GRONK
fo4aiu5	1587501000	Bengals	team	Joe daddy
fo4aiz1	1587501001	Steelers	nfl	Is Gronk even going to play?
fo4aj5w	1587501004	Patriots	nfl	Was hoping we could do Gronka high 3rd for a 2nd but oh well. Allin on taking Brady in fantasy this season
fo4aj6d	1587501005	Chargers	nfl	Antonio Brown punching the air right now
fo4aikt	1587500996	Falcons	nfl	Adam vinatieri next?
fo4ailb	1587500996	Buccaneers	team	My dick is hard at work I dont know what to do.
fo4aili	1587500996	Patriots	team	I never said it was. You said it frees up cap space trading Gronk, it doesnt.
fo4aio9	1587500997	Buccaneers	team	I really dont get all the people saying we need to dump OJ, Gronk has been injured a shit ton and will be 31 when the season starts, Id rather keep him and Gronk
fo4aiq4	1587500998	Falcons	nfl	
fo4aiq6	1587500998	Bills	nfl	Oh no, what ever will teams do about having Brady and Gronk play in their division? My hear truly goes out to them. Also, a mostly washed version of them both at that.
fo4ait9	1587500999	Lions	nfl	Buccaneers are becoming the new lions
fo4aiu7	1587501000	Vikings	team	It didnt actually happen. It was rumored
fo4aiwj	1587501000	Buccaneers	team	Might as well get Edelman while you are at it.
fo4aix6	1587501001	Patriots	team	A 4th rounder is perfectly reasonable. We literally traded a player who was retired for a midround pick.
fo4aix8	1587501001	Patriots	nfl	Last time Gronk had a huuuuuuuuuuge announcement it was literally for a party he was hostingLove the guy but hes a doofus and he has spent the entirety of his post Patriots career trying to stay in the headlines to market CBD products lol
fo4aixm	1587501001	Packers	nfl	Someone in my keeper league drafted him last year in the last round.
fo4aj01	1587501002	Titans	team	True !
fo4aj2d	1587501003	Giants	nfl	Give them Edelman for a 3rd you cowards
fo4aj8m	1587501006	Eagles	team	Canadian Eagles fan and Raptors fan.I would boo Foles the day Id boo Kawhi. Which is never.
fo4ajaj	1587501006	Cardinals	team	If Gronk and a 7th is a 4, with his age would a 5th and a player be enough? How bout a 6th and Hassan? Would people do that?
fo4ajc5	1587501007	Broncos	nfl	Its the perfect mix of team and player.
fo4ajcb	1587501007	49ers	team	Yes
fo4ajfv	1587501008	Lions	nfl	That was also before AB is the AB we now know and love. Hes always been a bit of a knucklehead but not to this extent.
fo4aiwd	1587501000	Panthers	team	Good. Let the rest of the division hopefully burn out in winnow mode. We could finish our rebuild when theyre trending downward.
fo4aj1l	1587501003	Seahawks	nfl	One of the four good tackles will probably drop to 14. Probably Jedrick Wills. And Gronks blocking will help of course.
fo4aj2x	1587501003	Broncos	team	Lol chill with the 13 year old attitude. Hes sharing his opinion too.
fo4aj30	1587501003	Patriots	team	Not even a cap dump.
fo4aj69	1587501005	Buccaneers	team	Yeah were in a simulation imo
fo4aj7z	1587501005	Titans	nfl	What?Gronk is evolving!...Congratulations!Your Gronk evolved into Florida Man!
fo4aj87	1587501005	Patriots	nfl	Dude put a trigger warning on this, it hits too close to home.
fo4aj9r	1587501006	Titans	nfl	Go look at mock drafts JanuaryMarch that year, we needed someone opposite Lewan to protect Marcus. Got Conklin instead
fo4aja5	1587501006	Titans	nfl	Its pretty funny now that its not in the AFC
fo4ajk8	1587501010	Redskins	nfl	Edelman in shambles
fo4ajkn	1587501010	Packers	nfl	Truzz MBC
fo4ajnk	1587501011	Buccaneers	team	Antonio brown next
fo4ajf4	1587501008	Bears	nfl	isnt he the raptors ambassador or something like that?
fo4ajky	1587501010	Bears	nfl	Woof woof
fo4ajs7	1587501013	Patriots	team	Does this mean I dont have to see any more posts about all of Gronks lame offfield exploits?
fo4ajvy	1587501015	Chargers	nfl	What? Gronk doesnt give a shit to twist the knife. Hes just not going to come back. We already saw what he did if he doesnt want to play for a team, he will just retire. There really isnt a worry that Gronk will come back and add to their salary.
fo4ajjp	1587501010	49ers	nfl	i think hell be good, but not better than kittlekelce.
fo4ajk0	1587501010	Patriots	team	He wasnt gonna play for us.. but i still feel so betrayed
fo4ajkp	1587501010	Patriots	team	Lol
fo4ajns	1587501011	Patriots	team	Gronk was never gonna play for a quarterback other than Tom Brady, this is a 4th round pick for a seventh basically.
fo4ajod	1587501012	Patriots	team	Both dead to me. Was just thinking the other day how it was sad to see him go but his ending was awesome. Thanks for ruining that.
fo4ajre	1587501013	Texans	team	True, just dont want to give up too much
fo4ajul	1587501014	Ravens	nfl	Judging by the draft chart, id say they probably give up their second rounder (pick 42) if this were to happen.
fo4ajxo	1587501015	Texans	team	You cant read.  Ive clearly stated we need to move on from Bob.  Just like its time to move on from this conversation cause you dont know anything except hurr Durr anything positive means you love Bob.  I swear this sub going to shit now.
fo4ak1r	1587501017	49ers	team	i thikn theyll actually keep both.
fo4ak4y	1587501018	Buccaneers	team	Hes gonna get flipped in order to move up and get the franchise tackle
fo4ajm9	1587501011	Packers	team	Brady have one of the best receiver groups hes ever had.
fo4ajse	1587501013	Browns	nfl	His contract is fully guaranteed. Theres no point in cutting him. If a team wants him, they have to trade for him and there will be suitors with how bad this draft class is.
fo4ajvf	1587501014	Colts	nfl	Well we aint winning shit.
fo4ajyo	1587501016	Patriots	nfl	OJ is almost certainly gone by the draft
fo4ajza	1587501016	Cardinals	nfl	Poor Julian Edelman man... he dont deserve this
fo4ak1z	1587501017	Chargers	team	Went to the online store today for the exact thing. They have the navy hats but not with the same bolt. Im holding out for it.
fo4akbv	1587501021	Steelers	nfl	Thats current WWE 247 Champion, Rob Gronkowski
fo4ak08	1587501016	Patriots	team	Free 4th rounder. Guy was going to stay retired if not traded to Tampa
fo4ak75	1587501019	Patriots	team	To be fairGronk had all the leverage cause you know he wasnt going to come back to a NE team without BradyAlso... 10 M cap hit for a TE who is probably not the same TE as he once was
fo4ak7r	1587501019	Bills	nfl	Lol how highly do you value OJ Howard? So far in his career he has shown to be at best a solid TE2, he definitely still has potential to be great but this league is very much what have you done for me lately if you think Howard is worth substantially more than a 4th rounder then youre out of YOUR mind
fo4ak9p	1587501020	Texans	team	Ok Bill
fo4aka5	1587501020	Patriots	team	At the very least I wouldve been okay with Cameron Brate since theyre going to have 3 TEs and the Arians offense doesnt utilize the position. Bills going to draft an OT with two left feet and one arm with that 4th and hell be cut by opening day 2021.
fo4akes	1587501022	Seahawks	nfl	For a top 5 TE price
fo4akh1	1587501023	Buccaneers	nfl	Whoever has a lineman or a RB to spare
fo4akku	1587501024	Jaguars	nfl	If we can get any compensation for Fournette then we take it. Our sub is being dumb about this, he isnt getting another contract so we might as well cash in anyway possible. Some of our fans are so rabid against the FO that they will blindly take the players side. I understand the dislike of our FO, but trying to get anything for Fournette is a smart move. Hes very replaceable.
fo4ak3i	1587501018	Eagles	team	Gronk to the Buccs. Fuck
fo4ak8i	1587501019	Patriots	nfl	some people in the pats sub were thinking OJ AND a second round pick was fair lmfao
fo4ak91	1587501020	Ravens	nfl	and any team besides the Bucs would know hed just retire if they traded for him lol
fo4ak90	1587501020	Buccaneers	nfl	Washington for Trent Williams
fo4akb1	1587501020	Steelers	nfl	They paid good money for that
fo4akgm	1587501022	Patriots	team	2020 is really turning out to be memorable.
fo4akak	1587501020	Saints	nfl	Love me or hate me I do be spittin facts
fo4akn5	1587501025	Raiders	nfl	FUCK YOU FUCK GRONK I GOT BIGGER FUCKING NEWS YA BOY GOTS TATTER TOTS AH SKEET SKEET SKEET SKEET
fo4aku9	1587501028	Patriots	nfl	He will get released.
fo4aked	1587501022	Patriots	nfl	TAMPA CALLS FOR AID
fo4akfy	1587501022	Browns	nfl	Im pretty and wont buy it now. I dont want to support a game that features a rival team. Opening the game and seeing something you hate right away doesnt seem appealing.Granted I respect Lamar and he isnt into the hate category yet, I just dont want to give money with anything having to do with the Ravens or Steelers.
fo4akj8	1587501023	Patriots	team	Tank for TL hopefully
fo4akle	1587501024	Patriots	nfl	this sucks fam
fo4akrn	1587501027	Raiders	nfl	Yea this situation is a little different than AB, Ramsey, Ngakoue etc. Its just the precedent it sets that rubs me the wrong way.
fo4akwq	1587501029	Falcons	team	Are you just willfully not paying attention to the Buccaneers team?  They have arguably the best WR duo in the league and now they have OJ Howard with Gronkowski at TE.  Their front seven defensively is nasty.
fo4al28	1587501031	Giants	nfl	Probably, just not wrestle.
fo4al2o	1587501031	Jets	nfl	OJ for Trent makes a loooooooooooot of sense to me
fo4akj6	1587501023	Bears	nfl	When I first read this I read it as Lynch signing with the Bucs, and I nearly had a heart attack.
fo4akkx	1587501024	Patriots	team	Honestly I wanted more but we got two 4th rounders hopefully bill can find the next Superstars.
fo4aknq	1587501025	Chargers	team	S1ay3r
fo4akog	1587501025	Cowboys	nfl	Now trade for Mixon. That shit would be deadly.
fo4akrv	1587501027	Jaguars	nfl	Howard would be a good TE2. He stays. Bucs obviously ring chasing
fo4akyj	1587501030	Patriots	team	Please make this the most disliked comment in this sub. Are you kidding me?? Grandpa Bill is the best thing the Patriots have ever seen, hes the reason we are who we are. You are not a real pats fan.
fo4al50	1587501032	49ers	nfl	Slow down hoss, the Jets very well could still be the 4th worst team in the division lol
fo4al8a	1587501033	Buccaneers	team	When we win the super bowl, the team better go celebrate in the ship
fo4alag	1587501034	Colts	team	This mentality bugs the shit out of me. Being a good player trumps being a Ballard guy. Hurts isnt a good NFL QB, plain and simple. I dont give a singular fuck if hes a Ballard guy.
fo4ald6	1587501035	Bills	nfl	Yes.
fo4al02	1587501030	49ers	nfl	Good deal for a former 247 champion
fo4al30	1587501031	Patriots	team	Great trade for yall. Getting any sort of asset back is huge
fo4al65	1587501032	Patriots	team	I never said you said that was reason they didnt get him.
fo4al8o	1587501033	Patriots	team	this is the correct take. we just traded a 7th for a 4th.
fo4al92	1587501033	Giants	nfl	By getting a 4th from a retired, battered TE? Yeah, no.
fo4al9l	1587501033	Patriots	team	This is awesome. A free 4th round pick for a guy sitting on the couch.
fo4alel	1587501035	Seahawks	nfl	Yeah well shed play blocks with you!
fo4ali0	1587501036	Dolphins	nfl	Florida Gronk. Maybe TB will use HowardBrate to get more draft picks and draft OL help?
fo4aljn	1587501037	Patriots	team	This offseason, man. Yo soy morir
fo4aloe	1587501039	Buccaneers	team	i wish publix was in NJ my cousins in fl dont send me subs ( i only go down 1 time a year too
fo4akzc	1587501030	Giants	nfl	What a fucking off season we have
fo4al2j	1587501031	Bengals	nfl	As long as the bolts are stickers they can be the same helmets
fo4alds	1587501035	Patriots	team	Jules is next
fo4alu9	1587501041	Jaguars	team	As someone in a Buckeye family, Ive watched Dobbins week in and week out for years.If there is ANYONE in this draft that has the potential to be something like KamaraCMC in this draft, its him.
fo4algj	1587501036	Lions	nfl	Well apparently Im a jackass because the Bucs sent a 4th for Gronk and a 7th, so I guess delusional was a little harsh haha.
fo4alne	1587501038	Steelers	nfl	0 chance he goes to the Steelers
fo4am18	1587501044	Colts	nfl	Gronk took those WWE lessons and came home.
fo4alha	1587501036	Vikings	nfl	Yes... protein powder
fo4aljj	1587501037	Falcons	nfl	Falcons probably knew this shit and already got a head start lol
fo4aln5	1587501038	Vikings	nfl	Oof, I cant wait to revisit this comment during the season.
fo4alow	1587501039	Patriots	team	From the sounds of it, Edelman seems like hes happy playing here. That sound, I LOLd at the meme.
fo4aloq	1587501039	Packers	nfl	This conference is already kinda tight, whats one more?
fo4alqi	1587501040	Patriots	team	Yeah Im not surprised at this return at all. Its not like we had an open market for 2014 Gronk.
fo4am4t	1587501045	Bears	nfl	He retired. Hes now had a year off to recover, is probably bored as fuck, and now has an opportunity to come back, play with Brady, and do it without any income tax.
fo4am5b	1587501045	Lions	nfl	Yeah, i think people are mostly thinking about getting the pick in, and the GMs are thinking about a 30 way conference with their whole front office  scouting
fo4am6i	1587501046	Rams	team	Lets be honest here...have the Chargers ever had bad uniforms?  You can pick any point in time in their teams history and their threads were top notch, I guarantee it.   The fuckers....
fo4am88	1587501046	Patriots	nfl	610 Stidham will be below average and we will be in full rebuild
fo4alq1	1587501039	Patriots	team	God fucking fuck.
fo4alyq	1587501043	Raiders	team	Hes a lifetime practice squad guy.
fo4am57	1587501045	Cowboys	team	This is different for most people in the US. 46 Million people make 15 bucks an hour or less, so the boss saying that is not only a very real thing that happens on a daily basis when downsizing  but unlike Dak Prescott, 15 bucks an hour or less dont get you shit. Much less your kids. Or your grand kids. People sign up to the military with a very real risk of DYING if conflict erupts for way damn less. Average for most enlisted is around the 40k a year mark. Same with Cops. Extreme high stress, every night is a possible bad night with exposure to aids, HIV, bullets and black eyes for what? 80k a year an a uniform that everyone hates because of Racial Tensions? At 30 million a year, Id be at a loss for words and would ensure that money goes mostly into interest bearing accounts. The font cash is used to pay off any property and the remaining interest is calculated against my total living expenses to survive care free. Pure liberty. Pure freedom. No chains. And on top of that 30 million a few days worth of commercial recording and a get another 50 million just on endorsements? You fucking kidding me? How is that anything like your average Joe making 15 bucks an hour at the USPS? Come on now. Theres a point where I say yes to taking my pay cut because to me, I CHOSE my career because my career itself is just as valuable as the money. I didnt choose to go into Aerospace because it pays well and believe me, it does. I chose it because I fucking love engineering and aircraft. So if I had a choice to take a slight pay cut (10 to 15) to stay at my current job or to take the same pay BEFORE the cut, as a landfill director for the city garbage service  Id say yes. Because the career is just as important as the money is. If Dak really loves the game and loves playing, that weighs on him too. Mind you I wish the best for Dak and hes certain to get what he wants money wise AND still get to play. If we dont pay him, some one else will. Easy. He knows he can stay at his job and get a raise. By a blanket assumption that his situation is applicable to EVERYONE is asinine.
fo4amga	1587501049	49ers	nfl	gronk to bucs actually happened? what the FUCK?that was so fast.
fo4am42	1587501045	Patriots	team	Not just that, but any team would need confirmation he is 100 coming out of retirement. He wasnt going to commit unless Brady was with him. This is an absolute steal.
fo4am5e	1587501045	Redskins	team	This tells me theyre good with moving on with Howard. Gronk on his worst year has been better than Howard.
fo4am5q	1587501045	Cowboys	nfl	Mr. Big Curse
fo4amdg	1587501048	Falcons	team	Yall gotta be shitting me. Brady to Evans, Godwin, and Gronk. Shit is beyond ridiculous.
fo4amkt	1587501051	Dolphins	team	But does he have the angle
fo4amnp	1587501052	Packers	team	WR is deep is this draft though. The NFC Championship game has proven we need to improve the run defence badly. So id happily wait until the 3rd round to take a WR. Give a LB and a D Lineman before a WR unless one of the top 3 WRs somehow falls to us.
fo4amq8	1587501053	Bears	team	I too am on the trade block
fo4amqx	1587501053	Patriots	team	I just see it as more capital for Bill to use to somehow get us a 2nd round pick.
fo4am9p	1587501047	Redskins	team	From what I understand Casserly was mostly just a get what the coach wants kind of guy.  Works pretty well when you have Joe Gibbs making the shopping list, not so much with Norv Turner.  Heath Schuler was definitely a Turner choice.
fo4ame8	1587501049	Patriots	team	We know
fo4ameq	1587501049	Patriots	team	With what cap space?
fo4amfy	1587501049	Lions	nfl	And she hit you up like totally out of the blue 12 years later? Thats very odd. She must be drunk and lonely during quarantine.
fo4amg5	1587501049	Buccaneers	team	This makes me very happy in pants
fo4ammw	1587501052	Chiefs	nfl	Gronk has always seemed like the antithesis to BB...atleast to me.
fo4amwk	1587501056	Lions	team	Genuinely curious but how doesdid Jabrill Peppers grade across positional RAS scores?
fo4amew	1587501049	Raiders	nfl	Where is OJ Howard going
fo4amgf	1587501049	Patriots	team	For real. We got a 4th round pick for somebody who wasnt going to play unless we traded him. Free draft capital
fo4amh3	1587501050	Dolphins	nfl	The question should be who does Brate go to
fo4amiy	1587501050	Buccaneers	nfl	Rojo averaged 4.2 yards per carry last season behind a bottom ranked rushing oline. Id say thats a bit better than meh especially if they upgrade that line.
fo4amnu	1587501052	Rams	nfl	Dont let your memes be dreams.
fo4amo9	1587501052	Jets	nfl	Imagine trying to set up your defense to defend Gronk and Evans? Wtf
fo4amof	1587501052	Patriots	nfl	Im at a loss for words
fo4amrn	1587501054	Patriots	team	I dont disagree,but..thats not a certainty.Given his VAST injury resume, and his shenanigans. His value isnt very high.
fo4amse	1587501054	Ravens	nfl	No
fo4amtz	1587501055	Cowboys	nfl	This is the way
fo4amvf	1587501055	Patriots	team	A 4th for a player who didnt want to play for our team.
fo4amyn	1587501056	Giants	team	Surprised they didnt try and get OJ Howard in the swap. Wonder if the Bucs will try and move him.
fo4an5k	1587501059	Lions	nfl	Jk
fo4amu1	1587501055	Packers	team	Its funny, I wasnt a fan of the Gary pick when it happened. Then the season started, and immediately the impatient its been 3 games and hes not a Pro Bowl level player yet BUST! takes started flooding the comments everywhere whenever his name got brought up. Now my spiteful side has taken over and Im basically his biggest fan.Seriously, though, its been one year. He plays behind two of the better guys in the entire league at his position. Last year he finished with 21 tackles and 2 sacks playing only 23 of snaps. This year, assuming no major injuries at the position, hell likely see more like 4050 of snaps, and those numbers should go up accordingly. If not, then maybe its time to consider that theres a problem, but its still far too early for that.
fo4an45	1587501058	Bears	team	Hes not worth a second, but if we traded down and took him in a mid round I wouldnt hate it. At the very least hes a meh backup in 2021 to whoever we bring indraft if Foles and Trubs dont prove themselves.I prefer waiting till the 67th before we take a QB though.
fo4anbe	1587501061	Eagles	nfl	And you guys had barely any leverage since his cap hit was so big and he could have threatened retirement if anyone else traded for him. Im shocked you guys got a 4th
fo4anen	1587501062	Buccaneers	team	Next stop. bill bellicheck and Adam Viniterry!!
fo4amw5	1587501056	Buccaneers	team	How long do you think itll take for Gronk jerseys to be available on NFL Shop?
fo4amyf	1587501056	Patriots	nfl	Can Gronk take his CBD pain meds now with the new rule change that they wont test for weed after training camp?
fo4an1n	1587501058	Patriots	nfl	If its not on the Patriots it wont feel good for me sorry!
fo4an6j	1587501059	Patriots	team	Gronk was not coming back to play for New England. That was never going to happen.
fo4an80	1587501060	Bears	team	Thats a good sign, and hes had some solid coaching. Having transferred like he did, with Tua taking over, and handling that adversity is also a good sign.
fo4ancz	1587501062	Saints	nfl	what the fuck?
fo4anjs	1587501064	Redskins	nfl	On which side?
fo4annp	1587501066	Bills	nfl	Not to mention you guys had a pretty strong FA afaik
fo4an05	1587501057	Panthers	team	yeah its probably good that this happens, it ensures that we tank for the next couple years and dont accidentally go 610 and pick 10th in every round
fo4an12	1587501057	Falcons	nfl	Pats fleeced them lol. Got a 4th for essentially a nearwashed TE who has spent an entire year off. This move was obviously the bucs trying to appease Brady
fo4anaj	1587501061	Jets	team	this today?
fo4anb4	1587501061	Eagles	nfl	Me too. Ill die on the hill that you guys wouldve won the superbowl that year if they wouldve sat dak
fo4ani2	1587501064	Chiefs	team	June or July.
fo4anid	1587501064	Eagles	team	That would be bananas if this caused him to fall to 21. Not likely to happen but bananas no less.
fo4anmr	1587501065	Falcons	team	I was always on the kinlaw train but after hearing the gronk news I think its a must for us to get okundah or CJ. We re gonna get eatin alive with all the options they have at receiver.
fo4ano8	1587501066	Packers	nfl	You think hell has any draft picks worth trading
fo4anrt	1587501067	Patriots	team	Dont understand how anyone can still like this guy. Hes a cheesy douchbag that took advantage of us fans hope that he was coming back last year, and used it to market himself. Not to mention making the team worse by not making his decision sooner.
fo4anhf	1587501063	Packers	team	Lol I was just gonna say everyone watch out for people talking about OJ, but youre already here!
fo4anme	1587501065	Eagles	nfl	I will enjoy watching this comment age poorly
fo4annc	1587501066	49ers	team	You might even say theyre a bunch of milk drinkers!
fo4antn	1587501068	Bengals	nfl	Panic pick
fo4anu8	1587501068	Buccaneers	team	Ill give yall Thuney for a swap of first rounders and a 3rd lol
fo4anui	1587501068	Patriots	team	I was gonna say the same shit
fo4anvd	1587501069	Seahawks	nfl	So a starting TE who was already a shell of himself two years ago, whos now going to be 31, with a 43 year old QB and a head coach whose offense has never, ever utilized a TE effectively? Plus its the Bucs? Recipe for spectacular failure.
fo4anyb	1587501070	Steelers	nfl	Got to be near wwe to defend his belt lol
fo4anz5	1587501070	Lions	team	httpsyoutu.beBeskbiJjCXI
fo4ao0x	1587501070	Bears	team	I mean thats fine. We can ignore the Trubisky comp. The middle rounds and depth contributors were not existent for Emory. A punter was one of the best draft picks for Emory. On Paces side you have Kwit, Bush, Hall, HoustonCarson, and Cohen. Theres no one on Emorys nonhighlighted players that even sniffs a fart to that group. Thats the difference, and a pretty huge one, between the two GMs.
fo4ao4k	1587501072	Redskins	team	 Trent has just as extensive of an injury history as Gronk.No he doesnt. Gronk had major back issues and multiple concussions.
fo4ankm	1587501065	49ers	nfl	49ers
fo4anmt	1587501065	Browns	team	Until this team is in the playoffs I will never say we have a playoff team.
fo4anob	1587501066	Vikings	nfl	What unnatural power do these Bays hold????
fo4anr8	1587501067	Patriots	nfl	For Trent Williams
fo4ant8	1587501068	Patriots	team	Thanks Mambaout420. Sure will.
fo4ao1x	1587501071	Buccaneers	nfl	Yeah so they need to do something about RB
fo4ao8g	1587501073	Ravens	nfl	And lets not forget... the Super Bowl is in Tampa this season.
fo4aoac	1587501074	Broncos	nfl	Not even a Bucs fan, but I want to see where this goes. Awesome storyline.
fo4aogy	1587501076	Patriots	nfl	Enjoy, should be a good time
fo4ansv	1587501068	Patriots	team	I dont like the shoulder epaulets or stripey things. If youre not a team with lightning bolts or something, numbers up there on the shoulder look fine.
fo4antc	1587501068	Chiefs	team	Ill take the over on that, easily.
fo4anwc	1587501069	Falcons	nfl	Welp there is that. Seems like a middle ground for both.  Not a high pick but not ass for the Pats.
fo4anxc	1587501069	Jets	nfl	Glazers back baby!!
fo4anye	1587501070	Patriots	team	Tbh I woulda forced him to stay retired cuz Im a spiteful POS for him leading us on all year last year
fo4ao1o	1587501071	Chargers	nfl	Lmao
fo4ao4y	1587501072	Buccaneers	nfl	OJ Howard has been in Arians doghouse, this has to mean we are shipping him out.
fo4ao9b	1587501073	Patriots	nfl	GronkHernandez and its not even close
fo4aocl	1587501075	Ravens	nfl	You sign off for like 2 hours and then somehow Gronk has unretired and is being traded to the Bucs
fo4aoho	1587501077	Seahawks	nfl	Over the past half hour Ive come around to the idea that it is simply irresponsible for the NFL to continue with playing a full season this year. Safety first. Cancel the season
fo4aolz	1587501078	Ravens	nfl	Im sure that kind of environment wears you down a bit after however many years there.
fo4ao1y	1587501071	Texans	nfl	At the same time.
fo4ao9d	1587501073	Patriots	team	Are you actually saying a 4th round pick is not something of actual value?
fo4aojq	1587501077	Bears	nfl	Always good to base your team building decisions on an individual  trade for a retired tight end
fo4aook	1587501079	Giants	nfl	I thought he retired?
fo4aorz	1587501080	Patriots	nfl	Im guessing CHI. That said, theres a lot of TE needy teams out there and this is not a great TE draft.
fo4aous	1587501082	Rams	nfl	Guess he wasnt just trying to sell something
fo4aoc0	1587501074	Eagles	team	Wed be getting him on a one year deal essentially, so I dont think the compensation would be too crazy. Would make a lot of sense for us at the right price
fo4aomp	1587501079	Lions	team	As long as its not at 3. I really like all of the players we could get, I just think we could get something out of it if we trade back.
fo4aon9	1587501079	Patriots	team	Dude hes nothing close to the best TE in the league unless his year off transported his body back to 2012. And hes still not worth much give he wasnt going to come out of retirement for anyone else
fo4ap3i	1587501085	Jaguars	nfl	Reading pats fans replies earlier, I figured Gronk was gonna cost Tamba 38 first round pics.
fo4ap3z	1587501085	Steelers	team	Unless its Antoine Winfield
fo4ap4m	1587501085	Buccaneers	team	Please draft OL so the old man dont die
fo4aoy2	1587501083	Patriots	team	Not sure if I trust Bleacher Report, but we will see.  Seems a little bit light to me, but that 4th can be packaged to help up move up and get a 2nd.
fo4aozp	1587501083	Buccaneers	nfl	Thats the issue with him though, he projects as a very good offball LB similar to a Mark Barron (measurables aside of course). In a draft loaded with elite DL, OT, WR, and QB prospects I expect Simmons to drop a bit. Positional value just isnt there. I wouldnt be surprised if Kenneth Murray goes before him for that same reason.
fo4ap1s	1587501084	Buccaneers	team	SHUT UP AND TAKE MY UPVOTE!!!!
fo4ap2d	1587501084	Seahawks	nfl	Im excited for this division to get even uglier. And Im also excited for Brees v Brady twice this year.
fo4ap6x	1587501086	Ravens	nfl	OJ Howard for ravens 5th round pick. Who says no?
fo4ap21	1587501084	Bills	nfl	WHAT THE FUCK
fo4apbk	1587501088	Patriots	nfl	So? Im a Patriots fan. This hurts.
fo4aplh	1587501092	Rams	team	We dont have a 1st round draft pick so it doesnt matter , but I do think they will unveil the new uniforms Thursday
fo4aow0	1587501082	Texans	nfl	I mean, its not a big deal since hes not good anymore, just a douchey move.
fo4aozj	1587501083	Chargers	nfl	Or goes out and spreads disease
fo4aphy	1587501090	Giants	nfl	Im willing to bet you a year of reddit gold that if OJ Howard is traded this year then it will be for more than what Gronk fetched.
fo4apmw	1587501092	Eagles	nfl	Gronk has what 5x the cap hit of the pats current cap remaining? Im shocked they got a 4th
fo4ap1i	1587501084	Cowboys	nfl	R
fo4ap8z	1587501087	Texans	nfl	He probably stays. Hes a great back up or TE2 on that team now. Plus gronk couldnt stay healthy before, maybe its different now.
fo4apcz	1587501089	Buccaneers	team	Thanks! Yayyyy lets fucking goooo!!!!For a 4th lollll
fo4apht	1587501090	Eagles	nfl	Should I just draft the entire TB offense?
fo4apl2	1587501091	Patriots	nfl	Our soon to be 43 year old 6 time champ QB? Yeah thats ok, not every patriots fan is depressed that were entering a new era, it had to end at some point. Im glad Ill get to see Brady and Gronk team up again
fo4apnf	1587501092	Buccaneers	team	A fellow packer fan lurking this subreddit
fo4apnu	1587501093	Buccaneers	team	Thats how we felt after we got OBJ last year. Minus the quarantine and deadly world pandemic. Also we sucked still. Hope its different for yall! We cant fucking wait for Brady vs. Brees 2x minimum a year.Cheers, new sexyjersey twins
fo4apsr	1587501095	Jets	team	Who in the fuck... exactly...is saying they dont want to be a Jet? This media clickbait Jamal Adams shit is fucking annoying, but the fanbase eating it up is making us look like a bunch of fucking rubes. Wtf.
fo4apea	1587501089	Vikings	team	well i hope its not a smoke screen. We shouldnt be picking a receiver in the first round with all the holes we have to fill.
fo4api7	1587501090	Chargers	team	He was a baller for the couple seasons we had him. Im glad we have Ek now though. I hope we keep him for a very long time!
fo4apil	1587501090	Dolphins	team	I think selecting those two OTs at 6  7 really allows us to do some creative things later like selecting Swift in the top half of Round 1. Go big or go home.
fo4apjl	1587501091	Falcons	team	Damn the Bucs could seriously be a top 3 team next year..... in the NFC South
fo4apri	1587501094	Vikings	team	Tyler Johnson, come on down!
fo4apsl	1587501094	Patriots	team	Bill is gonna start rounding up former Pats in retirement homes and trade them away for late round picks.When he dies he is gonna trade his own spirit and a conditional 7th to Miami for a 3rd.
fo4aput	1587501095	Titans	team	They look like they are these  httpswww.dell.comenusworkshopdellultrasharp49curvedmonitoru4919dwapd210arnwmonitorsmonitoraccessories(httpswww.dell.comenusworkshopdellultrasharp49curvedmonitoru4919dwapd210arnwmonitorsmonitoraccessories)
fo4aq0n	1587501098	Jets	team	Hello.I noticed you dropped 3 fbombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.Maybe you need to blow off some steam  in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.I am a bot.   Information(httpsredd.itexwvd4)
fo4aq7p	1587501100	Patriots	team	They may end up cutting brate now. We shall see
fo4apod	1587501093	Bears	nfl	Yea thats the issue. Hes the goat te, but hes done.
fo4aps7	1587501094	Patriots	team	Gronk had zero value for us. He was never going to play here. We just upgraded ba 7th to a 4th for free.
fo4apsj	1587501094	Ravens	nfl	why would they trade the better TE when theyre trying to win now
fo4apst	1587501095	Seahawks	nfl	Stahp
fo4apud	1587501095	Redskins	nfl	Id like to add him for cheap, even if just for a 1 year rental because I wouldnt want to pay him big money after
fo4apx6	1587501096	Patriots	nfl	Thank you for your service. Enjoy the weather.
fo4aq8r	1587501100	Giants	team	We had OJ rated higher than Engram, well Reese did.  Im not sure who stayed behind when DG took over.  Lets throw them a 5th or 6th for him.
fo4apz7	1587501097	Lions	team	Were taking Brown
fo4aq94	1587501101	Packers	nfl	Green Bay for a 4th
fo4aqem	1587501103	Falcons	nfl	DER HE IS.
fo4aq45	1587501099	Patriots	team	they ask you how you are, and you just have to say that youre fine, when youre not really fine
fo4aq6k	1587501100	Broncos	nfl	I really hope weve entered an era where Pats fans are content with their cock ring and are just happy to watch good football while the rest of the AFC is happy they dont have to pretend to hate Gronk and Brady anymore.
fo4aqba	1587501101	Dolphins	nfl	The worst punishment possible
fo4aqc4	1587501102	Patriots	team	Such a joke. Time to start the Tank for Trevor?
fo4aqk8	1587501105	Packers	nfl	I will take 1 oj Howard please. I forgot what good tight end play looks like
fo4aqpi	1587501107	Colts	team	Wow
fo4aqqr	1587501108	Saints	team	Who cares.
fo4aqrg	1587501108	Bears	team	Does it count as hoarding if you keep drinking it all?
fo4aqau	1587501101	Cowboys	nfl	Cam brate sir. The other harvard man
fo4aqx0	1587501110	Cowboys	nfl	But hes beating out such great talents like Kerry Collins and Jake Delhomme
fo4aqy7	1587501111	Patriots	team	dude yes, everybody in this sub is so pissed but i just want them to succeed. I love when ex pats ball out.  Thanks for saying this but im so hyped to see brady and gronk again. its not just about the jersey..
fo4aqj1	1587501105	Buccaneers	nfl	Yeah Im obviously hoping that we end up with prime versions of Gronk and Brady, but I think its more realistic that Brady is just a game manager like Manning was in his last Denver season and Gronk while an athletic freak hasnt played football in several years now.
fo4aqk6	1587501105	Chiefs	nfl	With the 6th pick in the 2020 NFL Draft, the Los Angeles Chargers select Mekhi Becton, OT, Louisville
fo4aqmc	1587501106	Giants	nfl	Not the news I was expecting today
fo4aqqe	1587501108	Lions	team	Nah, I can tell you right now as a mod of this sub that there are DEFINITELY people here who hate him as a person. The stuff Ive seen said about him and sometimes even his family is frankly insane.
fo4aqtc	1587501109	Redskins	nfl	They getting a fourth round pick.
fo4aqzz	1587501111	Bears	nfl	Brees was looking pretty washed at the end of the year too
fo4ar1w	1587501112	Patriots	team	This made me lol.
fo4aqnp	1587501106	Jets	team	Hellno I noticed that you dropped your Fucking brain, This shit is fucking useless bullshit spam, so the fuck are you trying to achieve here?

Even if there was an argument, budging in to spam it is never going to help anything, it just makes the argument worse and the hate directed to you, you even spam on therapy subreddits and trauma subs for fucks sake, I made this bot out of nothing but pure hatred and annoyance of you, who gave you the right to dictate what I can say? Why does it matter to you to constantly harass and annoy others purely based on your snowflake judgements?

fo4aqrq	1587501108	Patriots	nfl	Theyve also got Brate. Doesnt make sense to keep all 3
fo4aqux	1587501109	49ers	team	I dont think either team wants to give up their Bosa.
fo4aqxk	1587501110	Buccaneers	team	Dude I was agreeing with you in that Gronk only has one red flag just a very big one. Try to understand context.
fo4ar3s	1587501113	Eagles	team	If Nat replaces Eskin Ill be so happy
fo4ar6q	1587501114	Dolphins	team	I like Tool
fo4ari7	1587501118	Patriots	team	I honestly believe this will go down in history as one of BBs greatest trades. A 4th round pick for a retired player.
fo4aqvo	1587501110	Dolphins	team	Pats still missing a 2nd round pick.  Tua to the Pats is entirely media driven. The Dolphins can any potential offer the Pats could make.
fo4aqwm	1587501110	Falcons	team	Had me in the 1st half ngl
fo4aqxu	1587501110	Patriots	team	9.25M is quite a solid cap dump... what makes you say that?
fo4aqz0	1587501111	Dolphins	team	Im 30 years old. I remember 3 play off wins my whole life. The most resounding memory of my Dolphin fandom when I was young is the ass whooping we received by the Jaguars. Just pitiful.
fo4ar0j	1587501112	Patriots	team	2019 Gronk was worth a 2nd.Now youre telling me after letting his body recover for a year hes worth a whopping 4th round pick? At 30 years old?Brady obviously really wanted him.  Pats has all the leverage.Shit trade
fo4ar8r	1587501115	Browns	nfl	Maybe they trade him for Fournette? That could make sense for both teams.
fo4arcb	1587501116	Patriots	team	Not 10M worth.
fo4arcq	1587501116	Patriots	team	Haha dude no way hes better than Kittle at this point
fo4arf2	1587501117	Patriots	team	Tom and Gronk dont owe us shit. Obviously they were tired of dealing with Bills shit and want to take their talents elsewhere because they still love football. We already have six fucking rings, what more could you have asked for?
fo4arlf	1587501120	Bears	nfl	Says the guy who hasnt had to be in the same locker room as Antonio Brown
fo4ar1a	1587501112	Patriots	nfl	I mean Thuney is the most valuable part of that proposed trade.
fo4ar3n	1587501113	Panthers	team	Were about to get daddy dicked by the rest of the division for the next 2 seasons. Hopefully Brady has moved on to another team and Brees is retired by the end of it
fo4ar4o	1587501113	Cowboys	nfl	Curse was like, We gonna make this guy call someone a cracker
fo4ar9n	1587501115	Chargers	nfl	Coming from a guy with by far the best helmets, I appreciate it
fo4arc6	1587501116	Falcons	nfl	Honestly Bucs were a decent team last year, it just did not help with Winston throwing like 2 interceptions a game
fo4arfx	1587501117	Patriots	team	literally no one because gronk wouldnt play for anyone else. tampa and gronk had all the leverage here. we made out like bandits.
fo4argu	1587501118	Colts	nfl	Nowhere is safe
fo4armg	1587501120	Ravens	team	just wait a few months after launch and get it cheap at gamestopany used game store (if they are still around)
fo4arps	1587501121	Patriots	team	Im numb lol
fo4arqo	1587501121	Bears	nfl	How does this impact his holding of the 247 WWE Championship?
fo4arv7	1587501123	Patriots	team	Now both my pats jerseys are useless.....
fo4arao	1587501115	Redskins	nfl	The Bucs dont have enough cap space
fo4arbn	1587501116	Patriots	nfl	Turned nothing into something
fo4are2	1587501117	Packers	team	The only way HEs the top player on the board is if Gute and co are massively over valuing positional scarcity over BPA
fo4arn4	1587501120	Panthers	nfl	its a gift to get anything at all for a retired player. youre crazy
fo4arrj	1587501122	Buccaneers	team	Am I the only one that thinks this isnt that good of a move? Brady, exciting. But adding Gronk to an already crowded TE group, a group that didnt really do much last year under Arians scheming, and paying him 10 million.
fo4arwr	1587501123	Eagles	nfl	Name and number?
fo4as0g	1587501125	Giants	nfl	Is 2020 Gronk better than 2020 OJ Howard?
fo4as2s	1587501126	Giants	nfl	Gasparilla is going to be insane this year
fo4arib	1587501118	Rams	team	Im still not a fan of the logo but I agree with you regarding the Chargers they are doing it right. Their color rush jerseys are 
fo4arin	1587501119	49ers	nfl	Hows rsaints doing?
fo4arjk	1587501119	Patriots	team	They have 3 TEs. The Arians offense doesnt utilize the position for anything more than a 6th offensive lineman. You could have gotten something of value in return.
fo4arup	1587501123	Buccaneers	team	Stealing all our players smh
fo4ary4	1587501124	Packers	team	Dewit
fo4as1d	1587501125	Colts	nfl	I wanna see him get tackled, then a ref comes out of nowhere, does a 3 count, and now the defensive back who tackled him becomes the new 247 champion
fo4as29	1587501126	Vikings	team	Way to add nothing to the conversation with a condescending insult.
fo4as2n	1587501126	Eagles	team	Nobody is not willing to give Mills a shot, but at least we need to get a backup in case things dont quite work out for Mills. We have 5 Safeties under contract currently, McLeod, Mills, Epps, Ford and the new signing Parks. Mills and Parks only signed a 1year contract, and McLeod is turning 30. We need to get a backup with starting upside and under rookie contract, even if Mills becomes a decent enough safety we can not assure that him or Parks would be resigning with us next year.And the most important thing is that dont forget our injury history....
fo4as51	1587501127	Bills	team	Well he cant drop more passes than Knox so technically hed be an upgrade
fo4as87	1587501128	Patriots	team	Dead ass.
fo4ars8	1587501122	Patriots	nfl	rnocontext
fo4arzu	1587501125	Patriots	nfl	Theh wouldnt have made a trade without knowing he would.
fo4asdm	1587501130	Vikings	team	For the 14th pick? Im in if the BucsVikes are
fo4asi7	1587501132	Buccaneers	team	might play for the Bucs... FTFYIts surreal, but the Bucs signing GOAT and GRONK just before the season that may or may not be played, is the Bucciest Buc thing to happen in my 43 years of being a fan.
fo4asji	1587501132	Buccaneers	team	Speak for yourself. I despite your feline franchise. How are you wine and cheese supplies lasting?
fo4aski	1587501132	Vikings	team	If anyone wanted Dalvin for the 14th pick, I promise you we would have already done it. Hes a great, maybe even elite, RB when healthy. But hes rarely fully healthy and hes coming into a contract year. His value is higher for us than any other team.
fo4askm	1587501133	Texans	nfl	Jeff Fisher career record is .510.BoB career record is .542.Winning percentage is a more accurate gauge considering the years.
fo4arw4	1587501123	Patriots	team	How is this a bad trade? If we dont trade him we get a 7th rounder, by trading the rights to a  player who wasnt going to play for us, who isnt in nfl shape right now ams was pretty banged up last time he did play, we get to move up to a 4th rounder. We literally went from 0 value to a little value for absolutely nothing else changing on our end..
fo4as0e	1587501125	Bengals	team	If he goes for a Day 3 pick Im in because I love the player.That said, I dont think TE is a position they will or should highly prioritize.Also I have ZERO idea what OJs trade value is rn
fo4as3o	1587501126	Buccaneers	team	And is Gronk even our 2nd best TE? Are we trading someone else?
fo4as93	1587501128	Patriots	team	We had literally no leverage at all.Do you understand what leverage is?
fo4as9u	1587501128	Rams	team	Shut up, he explained.
fo4asb8	1587501129	Patriots	team	The part that I dont get is that we traded gronk and a 7th round pick for a 4th. Maybe if we would have gotten a 2nd or even a 1st round pick would have been a little more bearable.
fo4ashn	1587501131	Buccaneers	team	Gronk looked very broken in his last Pats season. Were going to do a physical, right? Like in person, not zoom?
fo4asio	1587501132	Vikings	nfl	feel like Thursday is gonna be akin to a wwe event
fo4asks	1587501133	Packers	team	Oh how glorious that would be. Gimme Howard and snag a WR in round 1. All in for Rodgers this year.
fo4astb	1587501136	Patriots	nfl	I DONT KNOW WHATS HAPPENING BUT IM EXCITED
fo4asu4	1587501136	Vikings	nfl	Wes Welker is really the only other player of note with Moss in 2007. Id say 2011 was a good contender for most stacked recieving corps with Welker, Edelman, Gronk, Branch, and Hernandez.
fo4asu1	1587501136	Packers	nfl	Wtf
fo4asw5	1587501137	Patriots	nfl	Gladly. Brady won us 6 rings he can do whatever he wants now for all I careIt helps the Buccs have been my secondary team since I was a kid though
fo4asw9	1587501137	Colts	nfl	The people who say that dont know shit about football.
fo4as88	1587501128	Buccaneers	team	I lurk in every teams subreddit now because what else is there to do during the offseason and during a quarantine?
fo4as8l	1587501128	Patriots	team	He did it through a Zoom chat lol
fo4asa7	1587501129	Saints	team	I cant wait for the New Orleans Saints vs the Tampa Bay Patriots! Wheres that Bellicheck signing?
fo4asf3	1587501130	Steelers	nfl	These are super hot.
fo4ashp	1587501131	Eagles	nfl	give me that blue jerseyyellow pants look every single day of the week. fuck yes.

fo4asrz	1587501135	49ers	nfl	httpstwitter.comunfaithfulguyzstatus1252688082270224384?s21Who is this guy and how did he know first
fo4assw	1587501136	Redskins	nfl	didnt the buccs already pay their LT?
fo4asm0	1587501133	49ers	nfl	well that definitely wont happen lol his cap hit is 3.5M theyd just keep him
fo4asmw	1587501133	Lions	nfl	Marvel movies dont have good cinematography lol. Yeah but neither do your favorite movies 
fo4asr0	1587501135	Patriots	team	I suppose I was the foolish one for thinking it might have a fairy tale ending. Instead it all came crumbling down
fo4asrg	1587501135	Patriots	team	To say it isnt remotely shocking is just a straight up lie. Its not shocking that hes going to the Bucs, but it is shocking that he is coming back so quickly without any indication of such until like 340pm today and its done within an hour.Dont act like you saw this coming.
fo4at0f	1587501138	Patriots	team	I hurt myself today...
fo4at7p	1587501141	Packers	nfl	Maybe time to start calling them the New Tampa Baytriots?
fo4asro	1587501135	Patriots	nfl	What the fuck is going on
fo4assn	1587501136	Bears	team	Absolutely ridiculous move by Pace. UstanMilkman is a key contributor to this franchise and has a huge upside despite his cocaine addiction. We need at least a 1st round pick for him
fo4atbr	1587501143	Redskins	nfl	Bucs got fleeced. No way this years season is happening. You giving up two picks for a guy who isnt going to play this year.
fo4atcf	1587501143	Eagles	nfl	Im shocked it took even this much. His cap forces the pats to cut players to keep him and he could threaten retirement if they tried trading him elsewhere...
fo4atlb	1587501146	Giants	nfl	That defense tho
fo4at7z	1587501141	Chargers	nfl	Theres a reason a lot of teams stay bad
fo4at8k	1587501141	Patriots	nfl	Lol what? No it doesnt.
fo4atgm	1587501144	Ravens	team	We would probably be a tremendously boring team to watch on Hard Knocks, TBH. I can pretty much guarantee that Harbaugh and the organization would do everything within their power to ensure there is zero drama during training camp.The most entertaining thing wed see is maybe Mark Ingram working on a new hype man routine for Lamar. Also the Hard Knocks annual tradition of a likable late round draft pick or UDFA underdog trying to make the team.
fo4atl8	1587501146	Bengals	nfl	Especially with whats going on in the Bengals front office.
fo4atlm	1587501146	Chargers	nfl	The day after 420 Gronk smoked a blunt and said hey what if I went back to play
fo4at45	1587501140	Seahawks	nfl	considering the last time she hit me up (2011ish) that was the case, youre probably right
fo4atdp	1587501143	Colts	nfl	I think there may have been some people that thought he might have to play zone or switch to corner because hes not super athletic, but he was a man corner in college and the transition to a zone heavy scheme was a big struggle for him.
fo4atf0	1587501144	Falcons	nfl	.............hey now. LOLWhen you work mostly from your office on a computer, you have the luxury to keep multiple tabs open. When you have a wonderful widescreen monitor, you can even keep both open on ONE screen!
fo4atrg	1587501148	Chargers	team	Stop, Im already shelled out a lot of money on jerseys
fo4atxu	1587501151	49ers	team	TT gets a lot of love, but I could take him or leave him. My roommate loves him, but I think its just that he sees himself in TT
fo4atew	1587501144	Eagles	nfl	Yeah I do it exclusively.
fo4atfi	1587501144	Patriots	nfl	Thats the worst part i was literally just laughing at the thought less than an hour ago. I mean it now makes sense but shit that was not how i expected my day to go...at least i could prepare for the brady announcement
fo4atft	1587501144	Patriots	team	Then let him fucking stay retired wtf do I care
fo4atg1	1587501144	Raiders	nfl	How is he going to defend his WWE belt?
fo4ati4	1587501145	Cowboys	team	I wouldnt want Brate for free.  Maybe a 5th for Howard but not really interested in him either.
fo4atiz	1587501145	Patriots	nfl	Are you serious? If they keep 3 TEs in an extremely TE needy league with fuck all available in the draft they are complete morons. Us giving them Gronk for a 4th was a gift, they have no reason not to trade Howard for way more than a 4th
fo4atjz	1587501146	Patriots	team	Dont care if its an unpopular opinion, these color rush uniforms are way better than the 20002019 era Patriots uniforms. While I loved the winning ways, Id have to say those were the worst uniforms that the Patriots ever fielded.
fo4atlf	1587501146	Eagles	nfl	Cut brate
fo4atty	1587501149	Colts	team	No
fo4atv8	1587501150	Patriots	team	No, Kelce and Kittle were better even when he was last still playing.  Ertz probably too.
fo4atx3	1587501150	Patriots	team	this didnt age well
fo4atxa	1587501150	Buccaneers	team	No way. Source?

fo4atk2	1587501146	Chiefs	nfl	Is Edelman next?
fo4atmn	1587501147	Patriots	team	As long as we get something for it, go nuts. Give us Howard and you can have gronk straight up.
fo4atpl	1587501148	Buccaneers	team	Brady2gronk lives
fo4atua	1587501150	Dolphins	team	McDonalds fries are only good when theyre fresh at least Wendys fries are decent when theyre room temp
fo4atur	1587501150	Colts	nfl	Im all for the belt going live on Sunday. I need Deandre Hopkins spearing a lineman for the gold Green mid play.
fo4au83	1587501154	Patriots	team	Not sure why so many people are missing thisGronk is less valuable than Brate or Howard because the Pats have no leverage. They either move him for whatever they can get or he stays retired (or he files for reinstatement which would impact the Pats cap)
fo4au8l	1587501155	Browns	nfl	What a save!
fo4auda	1587501156	Patriots	nfl	I mean dont get me wrong, Im still rooting for my squad, but Im happy to see Brady and Gronk teamed up again and excited to see what Belichick can do with a young team going forward
fo4atvg	1587501150	Eagles	nfl	He should really stay on the Bucs. Gronk doesnt have much left in the tank... 1 or 2 years MAX. he wont be the same player. Having OJ Howard and Gronk is what makes it so lethal. Gronk alone in 2020 isnt enough.
fo4atwz	1587501150	Texans	team	Kahale Warring could be a young Gronk for all we know. I doubt we go after a tight end unless we plan on ditching the Jordan Thomas.
fo4atyq	1587501151	Patriots	team	Im glad I at least live in Tampa bay and can go see my dudes.
fo4au0y	1587501152	Steelers	nfl	Please credit Leroy
fo4au7l	1587501154	Steelers	nfl	Eric Ebron for OJ Howard, straight up
fo4audz	1587501157	Colts	nfl	Id be happy if we signed Antonio Browns talents and not his personality, but thats not my decision.
fo4aukp	1587501159	Lions	team	Winnebago
fo4atxy	1587501151	Patriots	nfl	I mean.. I get prioritizing your health and future if youre Gronk. But Id be lying if I said it wasnt a little bit of a kick in the balls having him come back into the league for the Bucs the year after the Patriots were stuck with the likes of Matt LaCosse and Ryan Izzo at the position (I love you Watson)
fo4atzw	1587501151	Chargers	team	this aged like a fish youd win from a carnival
fo4au0p	1587501152	Packers	nfl	No one feels bad for you.
fo4au5g	1587501153	Seahawks	team	lets see if we draft him first lol
fo4aucf	1587501156	Cowboys	nfl	Well Hernandez doesnt miss
fo4auht	1587501158	Redskins	team	We getting OJ boys!!!!!!
fo4aunv	1587501160	Patriots	nfl	Cap space if he unretires. Itll be either cut Gronk, cut players to account for Gronk, or take what the Bucs offer.
fo4aupk	1587501161	Patriots	team	Can I get a comment for anyone who supported Gronk screwing the Pats this year because He should never play football again which would be detrimental to his long term health?
fo4auql	1587501161	Lions	team	Respond with glad or sadThis decision lead to us drafting Hock. Which are you?
fo4ausb	1587501162	Bills	nfl	Its incredible for them. They just turned a retired player and a 7th into a 4th rounder
fo4au69	1587501154	Texans	team	No
fo4aub7	1587501156	Cowboys	nfl	I feel like Tampa Bay needs to spend their entire draft on linemen at this point though
fo4aud7	1587501156	Seahawks	nfl	Oh, well now it just sounds like you havent heard httpswww.reddit.comrnflcommentsg5ms5hscheftertradependingphysicalpatriotsare?utmmediumandroidapputmsourceshare

fo4aufr	1587501157	Buccaneers	team	Its August 2023, Tom Brady finally lines up to take his first snap as a Buc.
fo4auhd	1587501158	Falcons	nfl	I would only move up if its to 1012 range for kinlawHenderson. Because we could move up for that without destroying our entire draft. But up to 59 for Simmonsokkudah just seems to be an overpay for something that wouldnt fix the team. I think it all depends what happens with tua and the tackles and how they fall or go earlier than thought.  But with the Gronk trade I see the falcons going all in for a CB. But hey last time we went all in for a player it was Julio. So I trust whatever we do.
fo4auk7	1587501159	Patriots	nfl	Theyve got Brate as well. Keeping all 3 doesnt make sense
fo4auu6	1587501162	Patriots	nfl	Moss, Welker, Stallworth, Watson, Faulk is better.
fo4av24	1587501166	Giants	team	Hell yeah, who are we getting a kings ransom for pick 4 from? One of NFC South? Teams is my bet
fo4av29	1587501166	Chiefs	nfl	The Patriots new uniforms are actually just whatever the Bucs are wearing.
fo4av4h	1587501166	Buccaneers	nfl	We dont have the cap unless Gronk is willing to take a monster paycut. We were at 8 million before the trade, Gronk is 10.  Even if he takes vet min Williams wanted a new contract in the 18 million neighborhood so I just dont see how it would work.
fo4av4x	1587501167	Raiders	nfl	Bucs trying to become relevant with the remnants of the Patriots dynasty
fo4aujz	1587501159	Bengals	team	I doubt it, personally. First round disappointments usually go for a 4th5th. Given his pedigree I could see a 3rd though

fo4awll	1587501186	Bears	nfl	Wouldnt hate it if it was for a 5th and we traded back from 50.Would also allow us to cut some of the fringe players at least.
fo4aw3s	1587501179	Buccaneers	team	Does the Gronk trade confirm the OJ Howard trade rumor?
fo4aw80	1587501181	Cowboys	nfl	Even if Gronk is like 70 of his old self, this is a great deal.
fo4awdc	1587501183	Saints	team	 BRADY.  TO GRONK! AHHHH GEEE GOLLY WEVE SEEN THIS CONNECTION BEFORE FOR A LAST SECOND TOUCHDOWN! The Bucs, pending the extra point, will fall to 79 to the 142 Saints.I aint scared.  Pass rush going to eat Bradys lunch in the pocket while the Bucs, as  usual, fail to run the ball.  Brees going to carve up that hapless ass defense like he always does.
fo4awdu	1587501183	Packers	team	Im back and forth on this  on the one hand, hes got one year left, so its a proveit deal and optional longterm commitment. I think hell be at his best next year.On the other hand, didnt they try to move him at the deadline last year, and couldnt? I cant imagine it was a lack of interest, they may be asking too much. I think giving up more than a 3rd for a rental is too much, and they might want more than that.
fo4awdz	1587501183	Patriots	team	why are so many people upset about losing a player who was never going to play for us again?

fo4awt7	1587501189	Patriots	team	Et tu, Gronk?
fo4aw85	1587501181	Eagles	team	And 2017 agholar was actually a really good slot receiver and it was our most complete offense in years. Most of the top offenses have a really good slot wr or wr that they can put in the slot with confidence
fo4awcm	1587501183	Buccaneers	team	What are you basing that on? OJ was on the field 75 of the time, he got a lot of playing time.

fo4axbk	1587501196	Titans	nfl	Does catching a football from Brady cause some kind of ecstatic, worldshaking experience? Because, it seems like all of his goodtogreat receivers develop an almost romantic attachment to him.
fo4axd9	1587501196	Browns	nfl	Yeah, both guys have spent their entire careers on the left side and probably wouldnt be too happy about switching.
fo4axjb	1587501199	Patriots	nfl	Why would they trade him Gronk is gonna be there 1 MAYBE 2 years max.
fo4axd1	1587501196	Cardinals	nfl	Lamar, AB, and Hollywood would be nuts together, the Florida synergy would be unbeatable.
fo4axd7	1587501196	Panthers	nfl	Poor OJ Howard

fo4axjd	1587501198	Bears	team	Best I can do is a 90s Maytag in an Almond finish.
fo4axjl	1587501199	Steelers	nfl	Depends on the shape hes kept in, because thats also a year hes likely spent partying and blazed a decent amount, knowing Gronk. His athleticism and size likely let him come back in relatively easily, but its still been a year of not staying up to NFL standards of fitness or playing the game at meaningful speed.
fo4axrr	1587501202	Lions	nfl	Yoooooo. They fucking DELIVERED. Best unis in the league by far.
fo4axy9	1587501204	Patriots	team	Well its not like Gronk was coming back to us anyways. Might as well get SOMETHING for him
fo4axzc	1587501205	Dolphins	nfl	No, at worst he is awful and doesnt make the roster come opening day.Not likely but could absolutely happen.
fo4ay0s	1587501205	Packers	nfl	I think he is over it now as he is super Zen as it is lol. I just mean that the Packers won a ring and have been more successful than the Packers since he got drafted so I doubt there is much bad blood now.
fo4axcp	1587501196	Colts	team	 Desir and Hooker played on the same side of the field.Well, thats not true. Gamepass is free. Go back and watch the Texans game. It took me like two minutes, and that includes signing in, to prove that wrong. Desir followed Hopkins. On the deep TD to Hopkins, it was Desir and Geathers in coverage. On the deep ball to Fuller, Hooker was the safety, but he was playing Hopkins on a crossing route. The 3rd huge pass was to Fuller again in what looks like cover 3 with Moor playing deep on the outside and Hooker playing to the middle while Geathers runs up into the box right before the snap. 4th deep pass was to Hopkins with Desir on him. Hooker seems to be playing the low middle of the field in cover 3 with Geathers playing the deep middle. Not going to call this one on Hooker unless it was supposed to be cover four and he played too low. Desir has always played fine against Hopkins. In the second game last season, Desir had missed a few weeks and wasnt even practicing. Same with TY. Both were rushed back for that game and it showed. TY couldnt separate for Joseph and Desir couldnt keep up with Hopkins.
fo4axcy	1587501196	Chiefs	nfl	Easily the best social media in the NFL.

fo4axnb	1587501200	Vikings	team	Do you think youre going to be downvoted because youre suggesting we trade Dalvin? Or because youre suggesting TB would give us the 14th pick? Because I think youre going to think its the former, when in reality its the latter.
fo4axoc	1587501201	Lions	nfl	Hes a good back but like you said, replaceable. I dont know what his value is but I agree the Jags should take whatever the best deal is and draft a midround guy or sign another replacement level guy is FA.
fo4axpz	1587501201	Eagles	team	Tired of us missing out on the athletic freaks that have character considered questionable...We never tend to take those guys but Id really like to see it more often. If he doesnt pan out, cut him. Its not like youre hitting on 100 of your draft picks anyway.
fo4axte	1587501202	Cowboys	nfl	Make sure he has a mask, gloves and hand sanitizer AT ALL COST
fo4axuq	1587501203	Patriots	team	youd rather him unretire and you have to release him since thats 9 million immediately hitting your cap and you get nothing?
fo4axx0	1587501204	49ers	nfl	Its a good gamble while youre pushing all your chips in on winning one with Brady.
fo4axt8	1587501202	Buccaneers	team	Just say it with me...... dream team
fo4ay2d	1587501206	Bears	nfl	The WWE 247 championship is about to get a LOT more interesting.
fo4ay4y	1587501206	Chargers	nfl	You gave us Tom Telesco and we gave you our dad. An alliance may be in order
fo4aya7	1587501209	Patriots	nfl	Getting a 87 Gronk jersey with the new design is tempting. They just look so good.
fo4ayfu	1587501211	Bears	team	I think hes Trubiskylite. Physically gifted but tape shows struggles to read the defense and get the ball to the right place at the right time. Id rather not go through that again
fo4aygu	1587501211	Eagles	nfl	Theres been some smoke around Howie Roseman being in love with CeeDee Lamb and wanting to move up to get him. Do you see this happening? If so, what would the price be? If not, what do you see happening with the Eagles at 21?
fo4ayh1	1587501211	Cardinals	nfl	Its already close lol that would absolutely be the best
fo4aytr	1587501216	49ers	nfl	im a community homer but let me just say...its really fucking good.
fo4ay96	1587501208	Packers	team	Cherry after Starrs wife?
fo4ay9z	1587501208	Patriots	team	No where close?Flat out disagree.
fo4aya9	1587501209	Patriots	team	Lol swapping a 7th for their 4th
fo4ayaq	1587501209	Cowboys	nfl	THAT SOURCE IS LEROY THE DOG ADAM. NOT SAYING THAT IS ASSAULT
fo4aybq	1587501209	Bears	team	Give me Nate Stanley or give me death
fo4ayct	1587501210	Vikings	team	.
fo4ayfc	1587501210	Jets	nfl	TIDE PODS ARE BACK
fo4ayio	1587501212	Patriots	team	Sick. Now hell sign with a team that has cap room, which we dont have.
fo4ayld	1587501213	Chiefs	nfl	Its because hes the exception to the rule. There can only be one.
fo4aypt	1587501214	Patriots	team	Comments like yours are so exhausting. Its an opinion, you can ignore it. Second, its not about the rings. Not at all.
fo4ayp5	1587501214	Falcons	nfl	Thats right, you should trade to draft the 5th best QB in the draft 2nd overall instead
fo4ayt1	1587501215	Colts	team	Hes a perfect compliment to Doyle itd be like having a talented Ebron
fo4aytq	1587501216	Patriots	team	So youd rather have nothing than a 4th?
fo4ayy1	1587501217	Lions	team	Glad we were about to give up some firsts for him
fo4ayer	1587501210	Ravens	nfl	Thats a little light on comp for our holiest of picks
fo4aylt	1587501213	Patriots	team	He needed a year off of the juice.
fo4ayq9	1587501214	Giants	team	We MIGHT have more leverage if ATL is trying to get in the top 4.
fo4ayy8	1587501217	Rams	team	Because of the uniforms?  Seriously?
fo4az0o	1587501218	Colts	team	thats kind of what you want from a free safety, though. to make plays when the ball comes his way and not be heard of otherwise. the strong safety is usually the one who makes plays closer to the line
fo4az4v	1587501220	Texans	team	Ok Chad
fo4aylg	1587501213	Buccaneers	team	Looks like just a 4th
fo4ayoy	1587501214	Patriots	team	Well have more wins then these other teams combined. Are you really worried about the uniforms? I think they look great.
fo4ayrr	1587501215	Patriots	team	Wait til Jules comes to training camp at 250 pounds
fo4az9h	1587501221	Titans	team	Love his ability to force fumbles.
fo4aywe	1587501217	Patriots	team	Why would Tampa give up a starting TE when they could give up much less? The Pats had no leverage here
fo4azaw	1587501222	Ravens	team	They dont add anything significant.In the franchise mode the scouting and player progression systems have been the same forever.The My player mode has been mostly the same forever.The gameplay you get some small changes like new plays in the playbook, some new animations on the field and stuff like the XFactors but its not enough for the game to feel vastly improved. Its basically the same game with features. Almost like they could have just been patching a single game since 2010 rather than requiring a new release each year.
fo4az0d	1587501218	Patriots	nfl	Sorry Lamar, Tampa Brady now has him in his sights.
fo4az1k	1587501219	Texans	nfl	Id rather Howard, just my opinion though. I agree keeping three makes no sense. Why do you think they keep Brate?
fo4az2h	1587501219	Patriots	team	How many first round pics did they get for him?
fo4az5p	1587501220	Panthers	nfl	I hate you. Congrats tho.
fo4az6a	1587501220	Patriots	team	K bye
fo4azj8	1587501225	Patriots	nfl	Oh no the duo that won 3 SBs is going to play for a non rival opposite conference team! What ever will I do?
fo4azl2	1587501226	Patriots	team	He teased us about coming back, but he did just to stay relevant and promote his business. Hes been using Pats fans since his retirement to keep the news on him when he never wanted to play for our team again. I find that messed up. And after a career of only Super Bowls and AFC championships he decides to come back but run when we arent the best team. Im a Patriots fan, not a bucs fan, so I think its reasonable to be upset that he screwed with us about playing for us again only to demand a trade elsewhere.
fo4aznc	1587501227	Falcons	team	I can see it now, 9th overall pick Isaiah Simmons of the Atlanta Falcons holding future hall of famer, who jumped on the bandwagon with Brady to the Bucs, Rob Gronkowski to three catches for seven yards while also intercepting Brady once and sacking him three times.
fo4aznn	1587501227	Patriots	team	Ok bye
fo4az6y	1587501221	Dolphins	team	Exactly. I was thinking about taking Mekhi Bekton too but those poverty franchises needed someone 
fo4az7e	1587501221	Patriots	team	Dude. No. Gronk could be with rest Top 5. But that is very much to be seen. Hes not currently better than Kittle, Kelce, Ertz, as it stands.
fo4az8v	1587501221	Eagles	nfl	Couldve, yes. Its more absurd for that guy to say they definitely would have. Especially considering it was in Philly, your biggest weakness (OL) is a nightmare against the Eagles specifically. We were excellent against the run. Eagles were just flat out better really. I just dont see it even with Sam.
fo4azev	1587501224	Eagles	team	He will always be philly. I could never boo him
fo4azhv	1587501225	Patriots	team	4th for a Gronk who wasnt coming back to the Pats this is the smart play
fo4azuf	1587501229	Patriots	team	A beat up Gronk thats been retired for a year. Hes not worth all that much anymore considering his injuries.
fo4azji	1587501225	Packers	nfl	Now he can sit out 34 of the year in a buccs jersey.
fo4azo1	1587501227	Panthers	nfl	I hear AB is available
fo4azq8	1587501228	Packers	nfl	What the hell is an NFL Power Broker. lol. Get outta here with that mumbojumbo.
fo4azwc	1587501230	Patriots	team	A dude who let his body get destroyed multiple times for your entertainment and helped bring several chips to New England? Fuck you dude.
fo4azxy	1587501231	Vikings	nfl	i mean belichick obviously sold his soul for all this success, hells got a stacked deck by now
fo4b041	1587501233	Browns	nfl	Chargers for Melvin Gordon because Hunter Henry is gonna leave, orJaguars for Leonard Fournette.
fo4b066	1587501234	Buccaneers	team	Our fans have been whining way too much, but Wine and Cheese  Fig Newtons
fo4azxn	1587501231	Giants	team	I was 100 convinced that Gronk was done with the NFL. Honestly I wonder how good hell be. I remember people talking about how skinny he was so there was no chance hed come back but apparently he has put the weight back on.
fo4azy2	1587501231	Panthers	team	I also understand they will be building a light rail spur from the practice facility to BoA.
fo4b038	1587501233	Patriots	nfl	Is Howards value really lower than Gronks?Howard is still young and talented at a shallow position and he has the added bonus of being willing to play for more than 1 team. That kills gronks value.
fo4b05v	1587501234	Buccaneers	team	rHolUp youre saying Im going to have 2 Bucs Jerseys Brady AND Gronk?!?!?!?!?!x200Brshutupandtakemymoney

fo4azs0	1587501229	Chargers	nfl	wait they arent?(((
fo4azvb	1587501230	49ers	team	The only change Id make is replacing the wordmark below the NFL shield(httpsi.redd.itxtyvmktaafm11.jpg) with the one weve been using for our end zones(httpspbs.twimg.commediaEBpJNFaVAAAKqqf.jpg) the last two seasons.
fo4azvd	1587501230	Falcons	team	Brian kemp why, why would you do this
fo4azvo	1587501230	Texans	team	Jesus, what is with people being so unnecessarily assholeish today? I did read what you said. I never said you liked or wanted to keep BoB, but you sure are trying real damn hard to apologize for him.
fo4azy3	1587501231	Seahawks	nfl	Gronk Im a Buc and Im here to treat your ladies with great respect
fo4azz1	1587501231	Patriots	team	Devin White and a 2nd for Gronk. When Bill starts over he starts with defense.

fo4b02g	1587501233	Colts	nfl	After winning Wrestlemania 36...in front of an empty arena.
fo4b03t	1587501233	Patriots	nfl	BB didnt meet with the 3rd string QBs weekly for 11s. BB didnt meet with plenty of players for 11 time each week including starters. IDK why people are defending this idea. In the NFL coaches are known to have closer relationships with their key players. We EXPECT THAT! Thats why this is even a headline to begin with. Yes, there is a function of bossemployee in the relationship because that is the literal dynamic. But that is not the extent. Plenty of players DONT call their HC to tell them about their FA moves. There is no requirement. Especially calling the HC directly in the middle of the night. This alludes to the respect and communication between TB and BB. This is not exclusive to those two in any way either. Do you think youd care to tell your boss directly you arent coming back or would you just communicate that information through the appropriate channels and call it a day. Brady could have had his agent tell the Pats, but he didnt. Its not Bradys problem if the Pats learn about his decision via the media, he no longer plays for them. But, he called up Kraft and BB personally because he has a relationship with them. He said as much on the Howard Stern show. Brady has said many times he has a great relationship with BB. They used to go golfing in the off season. They stayed in constant communication during the offseason as well. They built a relationship around both of their desires to win. IDK why this is even a point of contention. The NFL isnt like your day job, and the coach to player interactions are not the same or comparable directly. Not establishing a meaningful relationship in the NFL is a fast way to alienate a locker room that you need dedicated to your game plan. This is a requirement. The fact that Nuk felt he and BoB didnt have a relationship at all is huge because of the norm established. Again, I have no doubt Dan Quinn has a good personal relationship with Julio. Not saying they are besties and text every day. But I have no doubt that Quinn and the OC take the time to understand Julio more personally so they can understand how he can play as effectively as possible. They need Julio to establish leadership among WRs and the offense. They need Julio to run routes he likes and feel comfortable with, and they need him to feel comfortable communicating that information. They NEED to understand who Julio is as a person to allow him to be successful, which enables them to be successful. This relationship stuff didnt matter as much in the 90s and earlier, but today, a HC is expected to know how to build and manage the people inside the building. And not doing it with a star player is not a positive spin for the HCGM. Full stop.
fo4b08l	1587501235	Panthers	nfl	Ha. Im leaving it.
fo4b0g5	1587501238	Packers	nfl	Kizer didnt do any better in Green Bay, with a better roster.
fo4b0gb	1587501238	Bears	team	OJ has to be available now right? Tampa also lost some leverage on a potential trade
fo4b0ih	1587501239	Steelers	nfl	DEAR GOD NOT THIS AGAIN
fo4b0k1	1587501239	Packers	nfl	2013. I grew up a Dolphins fan because of Dan Marino and Ace Ventura. But gave up on them after the Jonathan MartinRichie Incognito fiasco. Growing up in Central IL, all of my Bears fans friends were dicks, so the Packers were already pretty much my second team and I just switched over fully.
fo4b0p4	1587501241	Bengals	team	Can you be a goat? Since there can only be one?
fo4b057	1587501234	Vikings	nfl	Brady as Florida man made me chuckle but Gronk can finally achieve his final form as the  one true Florida Man, its perfect
fo4b059	1587501234	Patriots	team	Were already pretty stacked at RB, I dont even know if Damien Harris will get playing time this year
fo4b07d	1587501235	Cardinals	nfl	I have a feeling with our connections to the Tampa organization...just saying.
fo4b09y	1587501236	Patriots	nfl	Even then, Id risk a 4th rounder to find out. Screw it. Great trade
fo4b0fb	1587501238	Broncos	nfl	Thats better than I expected the Pats to get. There was a whole lot of no leverage in this deal.
fo4b0b3	1587501236	Saints	nfl	Ok FUCC A BUCC
fo4b0jf	1587501239	Steelers	nfl	Deandre Swift or Clyde Edwards Helaire
fo4b0ko	1587501240	Dolphins	team	18 and both 2021 1sts for 3?Who says no?
fo4b0m9	1587501240	Redskins	nfl	Nah, hes still going to be in his living room because this years season isnt happening.
fo4b0n3	1587501240	Patriots	nfl	Am I a Bucs fan now? I think Im a Bucs fan now
fo4b0q6	1587501242	Ravens	team	You didnt include the one I think is most likely to happen28 and 92 for 21.  If no WR is there for Eagles, I think they look to trade back, and we can jump Saints and Pats for a LB.
fo4b0r8	1587501242	Patriots	nfl	OH COME THE FUCK ON
fo4b0ts	1587501243	Buccaneers	nfl	They werent better last year with 30INTs and about nothing out of the TE spot...stop it.
fo4b0wg	1587501244	Ravens	nfl	Fuck that. We already have a younger, taller, more handsome, and more stable version of him on the roster in Jaleel Scott. No thanks.
fo4b0xu	1587501245	Redskins	team	lets go get OJ!!!!
fo4b158	1587501248	Saints	nfl	Jamies was a hell of a lot more mobile than Grampa Brady who had avtop 5 line every year for awhile.
fo4b0fh	1587501238	Colts	nfl	From the top rope! Its Bill OBrien!
fo4b0nh	1587501241	Vikings	team	I like that
fo4b0o5	1587501241	Buccaneers	team	WHAT THE FUCK
fo4b0p1	1587501241	Patriots	team	Yea man... Why the hell should any of these athletes do their work where theyll have the most fun and enjoy doing it? I demand they destroy their bodies on the team I like just because they were a fan favorite.
fo4b0qr	1587501242	Broncos	nfl	I wanted him so bad in the draft we got Bolles (
fo4b13j	1587501247	Giants	nfl	NFC South gonna be a Blood Bath this season...
fo4b16g	1587501248	Buccaneers	team	Rotoworld right now lists compensation as just a 4th rounder.
fo4b0rc	1587501242	49ers	team	Man, I want either Engram or Howard so bad. I want a deadly 2 TE set so so bad.
fo4b0th	1587501243	Patriots	team	WWE 247 Championship too
fo4b121	1587501246	Falcons	team	Team 2! Love that LB corps. Ill always love Smitty too
fo4b14m	1587501247	Patriots	team	We also have 100 of the leverage. If the only way that hes willing to come out of retirement is a trade to Tampa, we can refuse to move him for anything less.  Its also worth noting that OJ will have next to no value for the Bucs if they get Gronk. He was already on limited snaps behind Brate. OJa 3 is the bare minimum to me.
fo4b19c	1587501249	49ers	nfl	I live in a society
fo4b1aw	1587501250	Jets	nfl	Well take him. Want Leveon?
fo4b0ym	1587501245	Buccaneers	team	I never implied it wasnt, was just wondering what other red flag was that OP was referring too. Try to take to your own advice.
fo4b0yz	1587501245	Dolphins	team	You arent getting it. If we dont draft Tua (i would cry inside), but if he Tua were to slide the Pats are in a position to move up (not to the top of the draft, but to the low teens) and get him.  Absolutely they couldNow I think we draft Tua.  If not I think the Chargers draft him.  But, if we both were playing it safe... then he easily could fall to the pats
fo4b0zk	1587501245	Bears	team	Hurts isnt going to make the mid rounds.  The QB class is bad and hes got talent.
fo4b1as	1587501250	Patriots	nfl	What is going on
fo4b1b6	1587501250	Patriots	team	youd rather him unretire and you have to release him since thats 9 million immediately hitting your cap and you get nothing?
fo4b1dm	1587501251	Seahawks	nfl	He wouldnt fit with Brady, hes not great in the passing game.
fo4b1k3	1587501254	Saints	nfl	wtf I hate the Bucs now?
fo4b1l7	1587501254	Patriots	nfl	Would be the perfect fit for them
fo4b1l5	1587501254	Colts	nfl	Dont discount the Colts. Reich has always favored two tight end sets and needs to replace Ebron with another athletic TE. He could be cheap enough for Chris Ballard to take a flyer.
fo4b15i	1587501248	Seahawks	nfl	The common thread seems to be heavy drinking and breaking things.
fo4b17w	1587501249	Bears	nfl	si
fo4b18h	1587501249	Saints	nfl	I hate our division so bad. Carolina finally trends downward just for the bucs to all of a sudden stack up 
fo4b1am	1587501250	Seahawks	nfl	He wasnt definitely top 10 statistically in the time he played. Injuries are definitely a worry but thats so incorrect.
fo4b1e5	1587501251	Patriots	team	No loss
fo4b1et	1587501252	Texans	team	We could use a really good te we have a bunch of te but theres not a star te just a bunch of te with almost the same skill level
fo4b1f5	1587501252	Browns	team	He has that our defense has given up a TD on every drive look on his face.
fo4b1gt	1587501252	Buccaneers	nfl	Good we need to stay humble
fo4b1gx	1587501253	Cardinals	team	Just sports has them in stock, use coupon code Survey20 to save a few bucks, Im about to order the black alternate, with tax and all its 130, the website is shopjustsports.com
fo4b1jx	1587501254	Eagles	nfl	I loved watching Gronk in college, BUT THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. WE ARE ALL SAINTS FANS ON THIS CURSED DAY.
fo4b1to	1587501258	Vikings	team	WR is a huge hole as well.You pick the best play available at holes on your roster.
fo4b1ly	1587501254	Patriots	team	Same im so happy tampa os a vanilla franchise thay i never had any strong feelings for. If he went to colts it wouldve been tough.
fo4b1pd	1587501256	Patriots	team	He was clearly done with New England
fo4b1r2	1587501257	Patriots	nfl	Also the fact that the Patriots had literally ZERO leverage. We either trade him to the Bucs or release him the moment he applies for reinstatement. We have barely like 2m in cap space.
fo4b1t3	1587501257	Buccaneers	nfl	savedujoey5280 Gronk is washed. Brady is washed. OLine is average Has Saints Flair
fo4b1w5	1587501258	Eagles	team	Its wild how ok so many here are with giving Wentz just an ok WR core. Youre setting him up for failure in a pass happy league. He shouldnt have to will the team to victory every single week. Get the dude a real weapon on the outside.
fo4b26p	1587501262	Seahawks	nfl	I didnt realize its F5 season
fo4b27w	1587501263	Patriots	nfl	That edit is the cringiest thing Ive seen all day
fo4b28q	1587501263	Vikings	team	Ill take it any day.
fo4b1ru	1587501257	Packers	nfl	Howard is a free agent at the end of the year
fo4b1tb	1587501257	Patriots	team	Looks like the actual trade was the most Belichick trade of all time.
fo4b1ud	1587501258	Jaguars	team	lol
fo4b1vm	1587501258	Patriots	team	It was 
fo4b1w6	1587501258	Panthers	nfl	Oh yeah. Against our defence twice a year. Cool.
fo4b1yv	1587501260	Rams	team	The logo looks like somebodys been playing too much Borderlands 3 lol.
fo4b278	1587501263	Rams	team	Ugh ur right .... the unis are going to be bad ..... HOW DO YOU MISS ????? We have the most iconic helmet jersey periodttt!!!... Im losing hope.
fo4b28x	1587501263	Patriots	team	Lol a 4th and yall gave up a 7th too.
fo4b2d4	1587501265	Patriots	team	I wonder if were getting pick 117 or 139?
fo4b2dq	1587501265	Falcons	team	welcome home gurley
fo4b2es	1587501265	Patriots	team	Like what? How are you going to negotiate up when theres no competition for him?
fo4b2l2	1587501268	Texans	team	Nah, they brought Kyler in because he is an exceptional talent, and was a cant miss prospect, having him fit the system was more of a bonus, he got better throughout the year. Plus your judging him on one year. Also the entire system?? What?? Sure hes LEADING that system but I dont understand how he IS the system, sure it fits him (also again how is that a negative?) Plus they didnt hire Kingsbury just for Murray, they werent even looking at murray at that point it was only when before the combine and Kingsbury started rambling about Kyler, and when they looked at him at the combine (and his pro day) they saw a cant miss prospect. So again I dont see how the reasons you said equal to him being a bust.
fo4b2nb	1587501269	Patriots	team	Come on down julez!!!
fo4b2pi	1587501270	Falcons	team	Switch Keanu to LB, have Rico and Kazee as safeties. Idk man we have no depth
fo4b29z	1587501264	49ers	team	Bucs need a RB but uncertain if Arians would want Coleman or Breida. Bucs would probably prefer a pass catching RB to help Brady and complement RoJo but thats not really Coleman or Breidas forte. Wouldnt be surprised if the Bucs drafted a RB with their 2nd round pick either
fo4b2c2	1587501264	Cardinals	nfl	Brees is about to retire before Brady and will likely get first rounded again lol
fo4b2kf	1587501268	Ravens	nfl	Anyone ever think that whats happened to Brown might have been the reality check he needed. Assuming hes even allowed to play football ever again, whose to say that the Ravens might just be the organization to calm his diva shit down. To completely knock on the Steelers organization. They arent exactly known as the team to prevent diva behavior. Tomlin is weak, lets his players get away with anything they want. Maybe the ravens organization is just better at controlling their players.
fo4b320	1587501274	Colts	team	Throw a fourth rounder Tampas way. They sent one of their fourths (either 117 or 139, I havent seen which confirmed) for Gronk, getting 122 back for OJ would be a good deal for them. And OJ is probably better than any player I could see us drafting there.
fo4b2of	1587501269	Vikings	team	 I disagree with everything you just said lol.Thats OK, that doesnt change the fact that Im right.  We literally did all of those things to mitigate our weakness at G, and we had a bottom 5 offensive line. You can only hide so much.And the Vikings had a top 10 offense by DVOA despite having the 5th cheapest offense in the entire league. And we were paying sticker price for that offense  Diggs, Thielen, Rudy, Kirk, etc were all getting paid market rate. So its not like we had a star QB or WR on a rookie deal that was creating that discrepancy. Stefanski did good job at trying to hide OL deficiencies, and it worked. In the 5 years running up into their superbowl (12, 13, 14, 15, 16  won in 17), heres the OL players they drafted in the first two rounds 1. Lane Johnson at 4 overallThats it. They invested 1 high pick in OL in 6 years. Thats not investing heavily. And even when the Eagles go out and signed FAs in OL  they didnt invest heavily in the top FAs. For example, they had signed Brandon Brooks to an 8MM APY contract. The highest paid guard at the time was Kelechi Osemele, who had 12MM APY. So to say The eagles invested heavily is just not true, and its something made up to support a biased opinion.  Teams like the vikings have invested more than the Eagles. Investing in the OL doesnt work out. Saying we lost because of OL! is just a poorly informed opinion. The fact remains iOL is less important than1. QB2. WR13. WR23. CB14. CB25. CB36. LT7. RT8. LDE9. RDE10. 3T11. NT12. OLB13. ILBSo I guess that leaves it as more valuable than RB, TE, and S. 7. LB8. DT
fo4b2wa	1587501272	Buccaneers	team	HAHAHAHAHHHHAHAHAHAHA OH MY FUCKING GOD YES
fo4b2xp	1587501273	Browns	nfl	The Texans, for their next three 1st round picks.
fo4b2yg	1587501273	49ers	nfl	Not their whole career. Most players have the self control to not do it when they know theres a possibility of a drug test. Josh Gordon had no self control as shown by his multiple failed tests. He has a serious addiction problem.
fo4b2zt	1587501274	Eagles	team	What a disgusting act. I hope he drops to 21, thatll teach him
fo4b31l	1587501274	Patriots	nfl	i was guessing for a 5th so him and a 7th for a 4th im happy
fo4b351	1587501275	Saints	nfl	Well now you have a 4th rounder you didnt have before, congrats
fo4b35s	1587501276	Patriots	team	Hes definitely nowhere close to the best tight end in the NFL
fo4b3d9	1587501279	Jets	nfl	Thats completely wishful thinking though.
fo4b2up	1587501272	Giants	team	IMO interior OL have a tendency to drop a bit compared to predraft projections.  A lot of factors at play but Id say more likely than not hes there Id put it at say 6040.
fo4b2v7	1587501272	Patriots	team	This is bullshit. Im gonna shoot myself.
fo4b338	1587501275	Falcons	team	Whats their to be glad about, the further exacerbation of a pandemic?
fo4b3ij	1587501281	Falcons	nfl	Brate took the job from Howard last year. And he was on the block all year. Howard definitely is the one getting shipped. With his age he prob has more value too.
fo4b34q	1587501275	Saints	nfl	If you consider Brees washed where does Brady land then? Brees actually had a decent year and as a Saints fan he had a decent end to the year. That playoff loss wasnt on him.
fo4b3dq	1587501279	Falcons	team	Truthfully, either of them would be great. Or Klavon Chaisson. But more than that, I dont want a trade up.
fo4b37s	1587501276	Patriots	team	So serious question.  Have you worked at the same place your entire life? If I offered you a six figure salary to come do the same job, this is all assuming you work, would you leave your employer and come work for me?
fo4b39o	1587501277	Buccaneers	team	Wow, just wow.
fo4b3fo	1587501280	Patriots	team	If the NFL season doesnt even happen, that would be a huge cluster fuck for Brady and the Bucs. He isnt their future. He is their now. And if now doesnt happen then the entire deal blows up in their face.
fo4b3ka	1587501281	Bears	team	Im hoping so, towards the end of last year I wouldve happily given a 2nd for him. Now I wonder what the price would be
fo4b3lf	1587501282	Packers	nfl	This is moving super quickly
fo4b3qn	1587501284	Patriots	team	let me know when he drafts a pro bowler we been waiting 7 years. he also took a rb in round one 2 years ago. the most useless easiest to replace position.
fo4b3re	1587501284	Patriots	team	Zero... fourth round pick.
fo4b3vt	1587501286	Patriots	nfl	Id say youre a salty fan of division rival but those are just facts.
fo4b3qk	1587501284	Panthers	team	Brown set us back big time, giving up a future 1st was absolute insanity and his worst trade, by far.That said, he drafted Munnerlyn who was a starter for many years and Lafell was a contributor.
fo4b3sy	1587501285	Patriots	team	I get that youre not from America and all but this is why people cant stand Patriots fans.
fo4b3s2	1587501284	Patriots	team	and then convert him to TE
fo4b3we	1587501286	Patriots	team	Okay... you were never a true fan
fo4b44y	1587501289	Patriots	team	For real, he was the fuckin man until he decided to fuck with our emotions, throw us the finger and retire only to come back to play with Tom in tampa.  I was initially rooting for Brady in Tampa, but not so much now that Gronk is going too.
fo4b4bk	1587501292	Patriots	team	No cap relief cuz gronk is on reservesretired but yeah your point still stands
fo4b4d8	1587501292	Redskins	nfl	Something something 6th round QB
fo4b4ff	1587501293	Patriots	nfl	The former. Ignoring his off the field stuff Hernandez was an amazing football player, could line up in line, out wide, or in the backfield and succeed at all 3.
fo4b4i9	1587501294	Patriots	team	OH COME THE FUCK ON
fo4b3yt	1587501287	Colts	team	in 2 and a half seasons, 7 picks isnt even bad.
fo4b44v	1587501289	Buccaneers	team	This is phenomenal
fo4b456	1587501289	Patriots	nfl	In 2007 he had Randy Moss, Wes Welker, Dante Stallworth, and Ben Watson. His Bucs group is better overall, but I think MossWelker  EvansGodwin.
fo4b4bm	1587501292	Patriots	team	
fo4b4nd	1587501296	Panthers	nfl	Antonio Brown is going to end up on this roster somehow or another
fo4b49l	1587501291	Vikings	team	Both honestly
fo4b4dq	1587501292	Panthers	nfl	Im finally hearing from recruitersheadhunters after like a month of nothing. Looks like some of these hiring freezes are starting to loosen up. Im guessing companies are also realizing social distancing is going to last a while.
fo4b4ht	1587501294	Patriots	team	lmao
fo4b4k4	1587501295	Patriots	team	genius move, give up a 4th round pick over spite
fo4b4m0	1587501296	Raiders	nfl	Downvoted for truth.  Hes battered, broken, and out of shape now.  Gronk is never coming back
fo4b4pg	1587501297	Buccaneers	team	Apparently its an old clip but still puts the mood on point haha
fo4b4qm	1587501297	Patriots	team	Yeah, no.
fo4b502	1587501301	Jets	nfl	Gronkko Bruce?
fo4b51a	1587501301	Eagles	nfl	Okay, what about to the Eagles for a 5th? I wouldnt say no.Who needs WRs when you have TEs s
fo4b4oe	1587501297	Patriots	team	He would have only counted if he played with the Patriots
fo4b4zb	1587501301	Patriots	team	youd rather him unretire and you have to release him since thats 9 million immediately hitting your cap and you get nothing?
fo4b512	1587501301	Cowboys	nfl	THIS IS MY PLASTIC FORK
fo4b523	1587501301	Packers	team	Any reason to get excited, or are these just camp bodies? (assuming there is a camp this year)
fo4b4vn	1587501299	Browns	team	My guess is the Redskins management has to do a good deal wtih Williams and is trying their hardest despite all the poor choices made by their predecessors.They are being patient, floating rumors and disinformation about their plans at QB, their draft, their longterm plans, seeing if somebody will go nuts for the 2 pick, etc.I think theyll pull the trigger on a move for Williams by FRI eve.  He becomes a fungible asset with much lower value on SAT morning.
fo4b514	1587501301	Giants	nfl	The Bucs didnt give up two picks, they swapped picks.And there is 0 indication so far that the season will be cancelled.
fo4b587	1587501304	Broncos	nfl	The curse continues!
fo4b4s1	1587501298	Patriots	team	A brand new qb in a brand new system surrounded by brand new linemen brand new receivers and brand new backs, no one knows his audibles, to think the Buccaneers will be good this is delusional. Brady wont be able to toy the offense like he did hear. He cant call a last second route change because he saw something in the defense like he could here. You cant just drop the goat anywhere and expect him to be great. This isnt basketball.
fo4b4zi	1587501301	49ers	nfl	I want him or Engram so bad.
fo4b507	1587501301	Patriots	team	Lol oh Im sorry, didnt realize that comments are only for agreeing with each other and not trying to stir active conversation
fo4b56u	1587501303	Buccaneers	nfl	LMAO..this right here.
fo4b5kl	1587501308	Patriots	team	Actually Id rather that he stayed retired
fo4b5n2	1587501309	Saints	nfl	Im not buying the dolphins passing on Tua.
fo4b5o1	1587501310	Buccaneers	team	Im pretty sure someone ar 1 Buc will think of that. I hope.
fo4b5f0	1587501306	Jets	nfl	Gronk LOL u got a bucc in your butt!
fo4b5je	1587501308	Falcons	team	Their QB isnt great anymore and their O line is trash. Why do you think Gronk is the same player he was 3 years ago his last year he was injury prone. Tom cant throw the ball 30 yards down the field anymore. Their WRs are studs but thats no different than last year. Jeamis threw a ton of picks but he also threw a bunch of TDs. I think Tom at this point of his career cant keep up the 30 tds and he especially isnt going to be as explosive offense as it was last year. I think they win 8 games. Maybe 9.
fo4b5sz	1587501311	Eagles	nfl	Hate numbers on helmets, but those dark blue ones fuck hard.
fo4b5x5	1587501313	Raiders	nfl	I cannot fucking WAIT to see Gronk at Gasparilla next year, holy mother of god.
fo4b5c6	1587501305	Ravens	team	I drew this up last year, thought it would be a good way to add more purple to the white and black jerseys, and add more black to the purples. httpswww.reddit.comrravenscommentsb967m8drewupthisjerseyideaandwantedtoseewhat?utmsourceshareutmmediumiosapputmnameiossmf
fo4b5iz	1587501308	49ers	nfl	Cant wait to see how the Bucs Buc this up.
fo4b5k2	1587501308	Patriots	team	Cant believe people are seriously upset with an almost free 4th round pick. Yesterday we had one 4th round pick, today we have two fourth round picks. It only cost us a 7th round pick.
fo4b5oq	1587501310	Patriots	nfl	Welker was a truly dominant force in the short to mid passing game. Actually, if you go beyond Moss to when it was Welker, Gronk and Hernandez, thats a pretty impressive pass catching group.
fo4b5ov	1587501310	Chiefs	team	AP was also brutal during that time period, they took posting seriously! Have a piece you wanted to post it better be in the right spot and well written.
fo4b5v4	1587501312	Patriots	nfl	Brady was a dagger to the heart, now Im just numb so I dont feel anything, fuck it have the Bucs win it all
fo4b62i	1587501315	Patriots	team	Fuck off
fo4b62p	1587501315	Steelers	nfl	Oh my god if we werent in a quarantine hed be getting randomly drugtested so fucking hard right now. Probably the only reason he figured he could get away with it.
fo4b67w	1587501317	Buccaneers	team	Shhhhhh....we dont wanna be the 2011 eagles.
fo4b695	1587501318	Falcons	nfl	23 minutes huh? Lot of edging there bud
fo4b6cj	1587501319	Patriots	team	Yeah i mean well see, but Gronk was nowhere near the best tight end his last season with us. Hes the greatest ever, but his body has taken some insane damage
fo4b5oo	1587501310	Browns	nfl	I feel like all the Pats are slowly moving to Tampa.
fo4b5t4	1587501311	Patriots	team	I want to die.
fo4b5vw	1587501312	Lions	nfl	Wow! Brady must be feeling great, like an open mouth kiss from his son great!
fo4b5xq	1587501313	Eagles	nfl	What the fuck
fo4b5y6	1587501313	Patriots	team	Yep, was hoping to get Howard and a 4th but still a pretty good return considering he could have forced us to release him if he really wanted to.  That said said still sad to see him go and honestly think he should stay retired for his own sake.
fo4b670	1587501317	Patriots	team	I appreciate you
fo4b6bt	1587501319	Eagles	nfl	I broke that curse in 2017 when I said we had a Dream Team. So I think its safe to use again.
fo4b6bw	1587501319	Cowboys	nfl	go buccs tbh
fo4b6e3	1587501320	Bills	nfl	Sounds like the router is upstairs and hes downstairs
fo4b6ji	1587501322	Buccaneers	nfl	Idk man Jared Cook isnt washed yet.
fo4b60q	1587501314	Seahawks	nfl	Fastest trade ever. Very weird.
fo4b641	1587501316	Chargers	nfl	Wait so can someone come onto the field and take him out for the 247 title?
fo4b654	1587501316	Patriots	team	Gronk hurts, I really hope the Bucs just fucking suck.
fo4b656	1587501316	Bears	nfl	I think the Gronk move is kinda dumb honestly but well see
fo4b65i	1587501316	Patriots	team	Slater isnt going anywhere. I think.
fo4b66a	1587501317	Patriots	team	Hes been out of the game for a year and has lost like, 50 pounds. What are you talking about?
fo4b686	1587501317	Saints	team	I wonder who theyd use to cover gronk? When they tried in 2017 with anzalone and vaccaro, gronk up 21 pts that game. Granted anzalone was a rookie that year... Hes probably not the same but still dangerous
fo4b690	1587501318	Panthers	nfl	If Vince has any balls he leaves the title on him until the regular season.
fo4b6dr	1587501319	Patriots	team	Disagree.
fo4b6ky	1587501322	Texans	team	Make sure you at least get a 3rd rounder for Deshaun, thanks.
fo4b6ol	1587501324	Patriots	nfl	in all honesty Id probably start getting prepared to cry... Ill be surprised if he lasts a full season, which is going to suck
fo4b6p2	1587501324	Buccaneers	team	Its the first image that popped into my head when I saw Rapoports tweet
fo4b6bo	1587501319	Vikings	team	depending on who is available, if i were gm this would be on the table... Reason 1  we are already paying cousins 1520 of our cap... Delvin is going to want to be one of the top paid backs  so  1520 million per year... way too much for an RB in the current NFL. We cant pay both and field a team... Reason 2  you can get a RB in the 2nd  3rd round who can carry your team to the super bowl. Reason 3  Madison was very serviceable in replacing Cook  when we sucked was when both were out...
fo4b6gf	1587501320	Lions	nfl	You had players running on the field with no helmets on a live play with no repercussions. The game momentum obviously changed when the call was overturned, whether you like to admit it or not.
fo4b6ij	1587501321	Buccaneers	nfl	You think Hayden Hurst got a 2nd and OJ Howard will only get a 5th?
fo4b6ju	1587501322	Buccaneers	nfl	Good point. Didnt think about that pesky financial situation.
fo4b6ks	1587501322	Patriots	team	Well, that sucks
fo4b6vl	1587501326	Patriots	nfl	Legion of Doom
fo4b6y6	1587501327	Patriots	team	Trading these pics for the 3rd overall?
fo4b6po	1587501324	Buccaneers	team	THIS IS THE BEST TIMELINE
fo4b6v8	1587501326	Patriots	team	Sour grapes much?...
fo4b72i	1587501329	Patriots	team	Hey. Your offense doesnt use TEs in the passing game. You have 3 of them with Gronk added. Ill take Cameron Brate instead of a 4th rounder.
fo4b774	1587501331	Eagles	team	I havent trusted a word that Howard Eskin has said since Ive been in middle school
fo4b7fs	1587501334	Buccaneers	nfl	Good luck to him wherever he goes. Hes got the physical tools, just needs to get his head on straight.
fo4b6sy	1587501325	Patriots	team	If one of them commits murder, you still have two
fo4b6vf	1587501326	Buccaneers	team	What a wild ride this offseason has been.
fo4b6xi	1587501327	Bears	team	Dont be ridiculous, hes is no Eric Saubert.
fo4b73x	1587501330	Browns	team	Wasnt the whole point of tanking to accumulate a bunch of picks to build a low cost super team that would win in the short term? Once we have to pay people its over.
fo4b792	1587501332	Ravens	nfl	Lamar runs
fo4b7a1	1587501332	Chargers	team	I miss those uniforms
fo4b7ab	1587501332	Buccaneers	team	Yeah ya do
fo4b7ef	1587501334	Patriots	team	Strongly disagree. I loved Gronk and consider him the GOAT, but Kelce is the 1 in the league right now.
fo4b7fg	1587501334	Saints	nfl	Rest of the NFC South thanks, I hate it
fo4b6xo	1587501327	Panthers	nfl	Im sure if Julian had a choice to wake up in Tampa tomorrow, hed dip out. Cant prove it so oh well. But this wouldnt be the first second or even third time weve heard a player come out and say it isnt fun playing for the Pats isnt fun. Look, Ive played sports most of my life and some of the most fun Ive had were the times I played on trash teams and collected stats and played with my boys. Obviously there are levels to this and its not perfect symmetry, but sometimes athletes wanna just ball and enjoy life and not be hounded by a coach all day lol.
fo4b758	1587501330	Colts	nfl	Do you want NFCS DBs commit seppuku?
fo4b76a	1587501331	Chargers	nfl	Its throwing shade at the designer for the Rams logo, how they spoke about the design process and what not. Battle of LA Phase 1 has begun
fo4b7ds	1587501334	Patriots	nfl	Jesus Christ lol
fo4b7e7	1587501334	Ravens	nfl	Just restructured his deal
fo4b7f4	1587501334	Ravens	nfl	Plus way more athletic and talented. Jaleel Scott is god
fo4b7h7	1587501335	Packers	nfl	I know one fan(httpsstreamable.com7gkym) who still wants him
fo4b7j1	1587501336	Saints	nfl	SERIOUSLY
fo4b797	1587501332	Patriots	team	we actually had no leverage and we basically got a free draft pick and entitled fans will still whine and call for Bills head 
fo4b7hh	1587501335	Patriots	team	Im with you, pats fans are delusional. Patriots had no leverage, may as well get something, its not like this is prime Gronk
fo4b7j2	1587501336	Panthers	nfl	NFC South chuckles Im in danger
fo4b7n2	1587501337	Patriots	team	Shutup Price
fo4b7na	1587501337	Seahawks	nfl	How do you trade a retired player
fo4b7u7	1587501340	Patriots	team	Ooof 1000000000000000000000000
fo4b7y7	1587501342	Chargers	team	I want to be responsible with my stimulus check money, but once the country is more stable I will 100 be picking up the the new powder blue and navy jerseys.
fo4b7if	1587501335	Patriots	team	Thats exactly what got us into this cap problem! At some point you have to pay up.. I love Gronk but we essentially just traded a 7th for a 4th considering we had zero expectations from him 6 hours ago.
fo4b7iz	1587501336	Colts	team	Maybe a family member needs to help him with finances 
fo4b7j4	1587501336	Bears	team	He throws ducks
fo4b7m7	1587501337	Patriots	nfl	per the packers(httpswww.packers.comnewsinfographic100seasonsofpackersuniforms), they had one uniform 1989  1996 and another uniform 1997present.  So nope.
fo4b7mr	1587501337	Buccaneers	team	Waiting for my updates now since I was scorned a few weeks ago
fo4b7ps	1587501338	Eagles	nfl	i think we memes the bucs into legit contenders
fo4b7r8	1587501339	Redskins	team	Id love a 2nd, but Id take this to get him out of my life
fo4b7z7	1587501342	Buccaneers	team	Pats fan checking in here as well. Go TB, the both of em. My NFC team until Tom hangs em up for good.
fo4b84y	1587501344	Colts	nfl	I swear if this team ends up being an 88 dud I will dunk on Brady fans for eternity.
fo4b7nv	1587501338	Patriots	team	It hurts but this is where true Patriots fans show their colors. These guys are legends and well always love them, but weve gotta stick by this team no matter what. Older fans endured 40 years of abject misery so we could have these 20 years of bliss, and now weve gotta test our mettle.
fo4b7uu	1587501340	Patriots	team	Fuck all of this
fo4b81r	1587501343	Patriots	nfl	Ill take the under
fo4b86s	1587501345	Packers	nfl	Martinez was a liability.Our run defense is terrible partly by design, were built to stop the big runs and limit them to using clock up.We are built to excel in pass defense but Martinez could not cover for shit, he was terrible but we didnt have a sub package linebacker we could swap him out for as Oren Burks never planned out and Raven Greene was hurt immediately as well. Hes simply a traditional 2 down thumper of a linebacker, not a modern linebacker.We lost Bulaga and downgraded heavily into Wagner but we upgraded Blake to Kirksey, we just took on higher injury risk there as well unfortunately.On paper were very slightly worse but we are more experienced, especially the coaching staff.If we miss playoffs itll be extremely shocking, means some big injury or disaster had happened.
fo4b886	1587501345	Buccaneers	nfl	Psh, for you maybe.
fo4b8a0	1587501346	Buccaneers	team	Did you get the new jerseys?  I want a Vea but when I looked a few days after the jersey reveal I did not see a new jersey with his name or the choose your own option yet.
fo4b8bz	1587501347	Broncos	nfl	100 but I think the fact that teams even have to THINK about Gronk will throw off their pre game scheming.
fo4b7pa	1587501338	Cardinals	nfl	Because hes better than Howard.
fo4b7vp	1587501341	49ers	team	Its kind of eerie how identical their careers have been so far.Both were drafted in 2017 and are 25 years old.In 2018, OJ put up 565 receiving yards, while Engram put up 577.In 2019, OJ put up 459 yards, while engram put up 467.Both players have 12 total TDs in their careers.They are nearly identical players. Evan engrams has had a slightly higher usage rate, but thats literally it.
fo4b7wm	1587501341	Patriots	nfl	I think he works Better in Arians system and there is a bit of a frayed relationship in TB with the rumours swirling as is. Not to mention, Brate is still signed long term while Howard is a FA at the end of the year
fo4b8el	1587501348	Colts	team	Competition gets brought in every year for these guys, its nothing new for them.
fo4b8ix	1587501349	Seahawks	nfl	I dont think it was a bluff, I think Gronk probably only wants to play with Brady.  If he says that, and Tampa Bay says that the maximum theyll offer is a 4th for a 7th, then New England has a choice between no Gronk and a 7th and no Gronk and a 4th.  Their leverage is the reason they got a 4th, sure, but they almost certainly got less than theyd have been able to get for him if he didnt just want to play for Tampa Bay.
fo4b8mb	1587501351	Bears	team	I do get the appeal of a winner. I like his upside in this draft relative to projected draft position compared to a lot of the other QBs in this draft, but Id still prefer to wait
fo4b81f	1587501343	Patriots	nfl	this bucs offense is like a madden ultimate team where a kid spent his moms credit card on legend packs
fo4b87j	1587501345	Chargers	team	Ayeeee LETS GO 
fo4b89e	1587501346	Bears	team	I wouldve been very okay with this. I was never happy with our color rush either. At the very least, all orange wouldve looked interesting. But I like your design better, OP.The point of color rush is like Halloween, to go out as something youre not, and going all blue with no change to the number font or anything else on the jersey was a very boring decision.
fo4b8a2	1587501346	Buccaneers	team	Im a little heartbroken, but at the same time Im excited another fan base can share in the love we had for Brady and Gronk.
fo4b8cd	1587501347	Patriots	team	He doesnt want to play for the Patriots. He wants to play for Brady.
fo4b8cb	1587501347	Chargers	team	Ohhh a navy helmet with the negative space bolt would be insane!
fo4b8dp	1587501347	Lions	team	I read malik hooker is available. Range and instincts as a true free, I honestly think he is a perfect fit in our stable of already talented safeties. Go getem!
fo4b8ge	1587501348	Bears	nfl	Makes you wonder if Brate or OJ are on the block for serious? Oh man... I really hope so
fo4b8lx	1587501351	Patriots	team	Yikes. Thats a pretty low return. But i guess sentimental value coloring my judgement here.
fo4b8o6	1587501351	Patriots	team	Supposedly hes been getting back into shape? I dont know. I havent really followed him too much since he left.
fo4b8qm	1587501352	Broncos	nfl	Biggest player transaction news of the day
fo4b8qo	1587501352	Falcons	team	Dont forget DEION FUCKING JONES.
fo4b851	1587501344	Falcons	team	fuck this man Brady smh, I really hope this season plays out cuz its gonna be a bloodbath down in the South
fo4b8do	1587501347	Jets	nfl	Tom Hey Gronk, come to Tompa Bay.Gronk Screw it Im down
fo4b8ht	1587501349	Bills	nfl	No its not lol, he was 6th in yards and thats the only stat he was top 10 in lol
fo4b8hy	1587501349	Dolphins	team	Oh man I feel for you. You have never seen the team be good consistently, that is tough.
fo4b8qp	1587501352	Packers	nfl	Tom Brady is about to be 43 and he flat out wasnt very good last year. But, I mean, look at those weapons. Hard to say if hell be bad.
fo4b917	1587501356	Eagles	nfl	I think mostly any QB would be happy to have AB. But if you get MBC not AB youre gonna have a bad time
fo4b8vb	1587501354	Saints	nfl	Ooh a mid40s failing QB, a banged up TE, and an oline Im pretty sure is worse than 5 Ereck Flowers. Im so scared
fo4b8po	1587501352	Jets	team	Build the wall. Doesnt matter if Jerry Rice, Randy Moss and Megatron are out there is Darnold has 0.2 seconds to make a throw or run for his life.If all 4 blue chip OTs are gone by 11, then fine, take a wr with the first draft pick. Otherwise this class is so loaded at WR and the Jets are in such dire need of building the OL for the pass and run game that it would be blasphemy not take one of those OTs if available.
fo4b8y0	1587501355	Packers	team	Churning the bottom of the roster. Happy to see Gute still working the roster with the draft coming up. Feels like you can take advantage of the mayhem a bit right now.
fo4b90o	1587501356	Patriots	team	Belichick couldnt even coach last years team to even one playoff win...
fo4b95k	1587501358	Patriots	team	I dont think retired players salaries count against the cap
fo4b95w	1587501358	Buccaneers	nfl	Nope, after we got rid of Hargreaves the young guys in the secondary really came around and most people have them as a potential bright spot going into next season. Were not great as safety, but our corners showed a lot of progress.
fo4b97t	1587501359	Packers	nfl	TODAY WE ARE ALL BUCCANEERS
fo4b99f	1587501359	Lions	team	I love BQ, hes the guy I wanted and if it doesnt work out then I wish him the best.
fo4b9c5	1587501360	Browns	nfl	Done.  Good job everyone, we got this wrapped up.
fo4b9dq	1587501361	Patriots	nfl	Bret Farves first NFL pass was to himself.
fo4b9gc	1587501362	49ers	nfl	Thats true, and with the possibility of a corona shortened offseason, giving your shiny new HoF QB someone he knows and his familiar with is huge. BUT, he was really mediocre in 2018. In 13 games that season he put up numbers comparable to a season when he played 7.
fo4b9i6	1587501363	Lions	nfl	Idk, Hernandez was pretty dangerous
fo4b8v5	1587501354	Patriots	team	I think I would have tried to get OJ Howard on a discount. Howard for Gronk and a 6th would have made me happier.
fo4b8zu	1587501356	Patriots	team	I agree I think hes gonna be great. His stock sure seems to be rising. Its borderline. I dont think he will get picked before the other 3 first round WRs so that puts him right at that lowtomid 20s range IMO.
fo4b96h	1587501358	Jets	team	Ill allow it. Lol
fo4b97i	1587501359	Jets	nfl	well this aged like milk.
fo4b9cb	1587501360	Patriots	team	I honestly your right a fuckin 4th
fo4b9dk	1587501361	Redskins	team	Looking at their cap, they wont be able to afford Trent
fo4b9fc	1587501362	Raiders	nfl	No, his biggest criticism coming out of college was that he cant catch the ball. Hes a really good rusher.
fo4b9kb	1587501363	Bills	nfl	BAH GAWD THATS JOSH GORDONS MUSIC!
fo4b9me	1587501364	Buccaneers	team	Lining up those 3 TE jumbo sets with Gronk, Howard and Brate
fo4b9u0	1587501367	Saints	nfl	Vegland
fo4b93g	1587501357	Eagles	nfl	did we just meme the bucs into becoming a contender?
fo4b93y	1587501358	Patriots	team	This is so annoying. Brady makes it sound more and more like a change of scenery was just as if not more important and motivating to him than getting away from Belichick, and now Gronk seems to be echoing the same sentiment. So, let me get it straight.. wahhh 20 years of unprecedented winning and record breaking wahhh my coach wont kiss the rings that he helped me get wahhh me bored wahhh. This wasnt about lack of weapons. With Gronk returning the would essentially be the same weapons from the 201415 seasons minus Amendola and plus James White. Just stupid BS that makes no sense to me. Literally pulled the plug on the greatest dynasty in sports history 2 years early, for what?
fo4b950	1587501358	Dolphins	team	Joe Burrow is the only real potential superstar QB in this draft and I believe our front office is approaching it like its Burrow or nothing Tua cant even stay healthy for a full season at the college level so I dont know how thats gonna work out in the pros where everyone is bigger, stronger and faster the Dolphins drafting Tua has always been something the fans and media pushed but i dont think the Phins are too interested in him. hes got durability issues, his arm strength is questionable and hes a bit skittish under pressure
fo4b9f7	1587501362	Browns	nfl	Completely this.  They can fuck off
fo4b9g3	1587501362	Seahawks	nfl	Unretirement squad would be a fun one. Favre, Lynch, Gronk...back up QB could be another version of Favre retiring...
fo4b9hm	1587501362	Patriots	team	I bet hes better next season than his last, after a year off. Dude needed it.
fo4b9il	1587501363	Saints	nfl	
fo4b9xo	1587501368	Cardinals	nfl	OJ Howard, notoriously good TE.
fo4b9hk	1587501362	Vikings	team	Is Dalvin even worth the 14th? Injury prone and is due for a new contract.Either way, bet both teams say no.
fo4b9q1	1587501365	Eagles	nfl	NOT NOW
fo4b9ly	1587501364	Patriots	team	88? Lol...
fo4b9mg	1587501364	Seahawks	nfl	What the buc
fo4b9nb	1587501365	Vikings	nfl	Technically the other teams d did it. You were just accomplices
fo4b9rq	1587501366	Patriots	nfl	It now means I have 2 games to really look forward to every week instead of just 1. More football is great
fo4b9xi	1587501368	Patriots	team	he wont be playing like the best TE ever next season so thats not what his value should represent
fo4ba9w	1587501373	Giants	team	if only there was a single word to describe everything you tried so hard implying
fo4bafp	1587501376	Raiders	nfl	Couldnt they push for OJ Howard straight up? That sounds like a much more palatable trade to me.
fo4b9xf	1587501368	Cowboys	nfl	This should be fun for all of us
fo4ba20	1587501370	Patriots	team	Who hasnt played football in a year, entering a season likely with no camp, a huge injury history, and is 31.if he came back and played, Id be shocked if he makes it past 33.
fo4ba44	1587501371	Giants	nfl	When the world needed him most, he disappeared
fo4ba7j	1587501372	Seahawks	nfl	Lol no youre not.I love how the Bucs are wheeling and dealing for old players on the brink of permanent retirement, right as the season is about to be canceled
fo4baar	1587501374	Patriots	team	By definition youd take less than a third because the second he applies to come out of retirement 10 million cap is on your books and youd have to trade him to... oh the bucs with even less leverage.Gronk did a solid by not threatening to do that.
fo4bacd	1587501374	Patriots	team	Most likely neither of these things happen. These tales are so dumb
fo4bagh	1587501376	Patriots	team	The fact that they just got the GOAT TE without having to move early round draft capital... theyre gonna trade OJ Howard to move up in the draft, or for secondary help.
fo4bai4	1587501377	Patriots	team	Ughhhhh
fo4ba53	1587501371	Bears	nfl	OJ is far more talentedvaluable at this point in their careers imo, and hes cheaper too
fo4ba8s	1587501373	Patriots	team	Hi, how you doing pal? Hindsight is tough sometimes
fo4baba	1587501374	Patriots	team	How is this a fleece? We had absolutely no leverage and the guy wasnt going to play for us we moved up from the 7th to the 4th without actually losing anything. How the hell do we negotiate for anything better when TB doesnt need him and we cant use him?
fo4bang	1587501379	Patriots	team	Pats had no leverage. Either trade a 7th for a 4th. Or nothing and Gronk stays retired.
fo4bacs	1587501375	Bills	nfl	GRONKA BAY
fo4bad2	1587501375	Patriots	team	Yupp fuck this timeline. Some how the offseason had actually made me hope next season is cancelled and both of them just never get to play for another. Call me selfish or whatever but I feel like we got screwed on all of this
fo4bahm	1587501376	Patriots	nfl	Yeah, I mean, even if hes an AllPro for Tampa, this is a huge win for NE  because he wasnt going to be an AllPro (or anything else) for the Pats.  Hed be sitting at home, with no production and no earnings.
fo4bamn	1587501378	Panthers	team	dude i hope corona cancels the season, becuase Im scared
fo4baup	1587501381	Buccaneers	team	Did Arians and Licht apply Madden cheats to real life or something? This team just keeps getting better
fo4bav4	1587501381	Patriots	team	Realistically I think we can maybe get a 4th for Thuney, maybe a bit more.
fo4balp	1587501378	Chargers	nfl	I imagine we will get some of those in the weeks to come
fo4bat9	1587501381	Dolphins	team	Idk, we had easily the worst roster last season. Now weve added a couple good pieces in FA so its probably not the worst any more. After the draft, hopefully all the pieces we can add pushes us to having a close to average roster.
fo4baxk	1587501382	Bears	nfl	Wait til you meet Julio Edelman
fo4bb6e	1587501386	Patriots	team	so what happens when he retires?
fo4bao1	1587501379	Patriots	nfl	I am a buccaneers fan and always have been 
fo4bata	1587501381	Chargers	nfl	So after someone tackles him does a ref need to count to 3 for there to be a new title holder?
fo4bb0q	1587501384	Bears	team	How you got downvoted is beyond me. Kyler is a fantastic young QB.
fo4bb8n	1587501387	Bears	team	Agreed. By any metric hes the greatest returner of all time. I cant see a compelling argument why the GOAT at any position shouldnt be in
fo4bbaf	1587501388	Patriots	team	Hold up I thought he was retired? How is he still tradeable?
fo4bax7	1587501382	Chargers	nfl	Calm down from writing a reasonable, accurate statement without any cuss words or exclamation points? lol
fo4bb4x	1587501385	Patriots	nfl	Oh how dare you lol
fo4bb5g	1587501386	Saints	nfl	Worked hard to make sure his sons didnt have to deal with the same situation
fo4bb6b	1587501386	Patriots	team	Hopefully the patriots could still find a way to get Oj Howard. The patriots have no tight ends worth a damn
fo4bb7t	1587501387	49ers	team	I think its debatable.  Engram has shown more when hes on the field..  Howards worst year was last year.  But Engram is a much bigger injury risk.  I think theyll be valued the same.
fo4bbb7	1587501388	Colts	team	Tight
fo4bbjh	1587501391	Patriots	team	I CANNOT wait to root against the Bucs next year.
fo4bazg	1587501383	Lions	team	Yeah Virgin was horrible about that last year. Seemed like every other punt and PR he was flagged for something
fo4bb18	1587501384	Giants	team	If we dont take Simmons I will not watch until Gettleman is gone. Theres no clear consensus number 1 tackle and I dont want them to take chances. You have LT 2.0 on the board. Take him.
fo4bb4g	1587501385	Vikings	nfl	160 season had Moss (1500) Welker (1200) and Stallworth (700). Not a bad trio plus a decent backfield and Jabar Gaffney as a 4th option
fo4bbat	1587501388	Ravens	team	Get that bag LJ. Fuck all this noise about a curse.
fo4bbax	1587501388	Patriots	team	Fuck imagine
fo4bbiw	1587501391	Eagles	nfl	SHOEDROPPED
fo4bbpf	1587501394	Eagles	team	Asac Schrader?
fo4bb8o	1587501387	Seahawks	nfl	httpstwitter.comrapsheetstatus1252694441023938574?s21
fo4bbbh	1587501388	Buccaneers	team	Well, OJ is in for 3.5 million this year, and Brate for 4.2.  If we trade away either, youre only adding 56 million for Gronk (who comes in at 9 million, though maybe 2M is dead cap to NE??)
fo4bbbu	1587501388	49ers	nfl	This is prime offseason boys.
fo4bbfk	1587501390	Cowboys	nfl	And the guy he threw it too wasnt that great of a receiver.Oh T.Williams, you body catcher you.
fo4bbna	1587501393	Buccaneers	nfl	I got to eat some cereal and THIS HAPPENS.
fo4bbel	1587501389	Panthers	nfl	At least you dont play them twice a year
fo4bbjf	1587501391	Colts	team	Fitzpatrick went for two firsts right? Id say Hooker is worth a mid to high 2nd at least
fo4bbti	1587501395	Patriots	team	He is not currently the best TE in the league, not if hes as hampered physically as he was in his last year here. Certainly still firmly top 5, but I dont see how you could possibly put him over Kittle at this point. Kittle is on the same tier of blocking as Gronk (possibly a tier below) but as it stands right now Kittle is much more effective in the passing game. Still probably wouldve liked to see a 3rd for him, but I understand TB not wanting to give that up for just one year of postretirement Gronk.
fo4bc91	1587501400	Vikings	team	I refuse to believe someone as active as you in the sub is so ignorant as to truly believe any team would trade 14 for an injury prone RB who will get paid soon. So what is your deal? Is this supposed to be funny? If so, how?
fo4bbpq	1587501394	Jets	team	Thats prob just evidence Jamal isnt top 10 lol.  IIRC that list had like Wilson 1, CMC before Mahomes, and Evans as the only WR?  Cowherd is a troll.
fo4bbtb	1587501395	Bills	team	Yes. SB 3 in the early 70s. Years before we were born. Something to hang your hat on. Lol.
fo4bcan	1587501401	Cardinals	nfl	So what round should I take Gronkowski in fantasy?
fo4bcjj	1587501404	Jets	nfl	I mean, his name is OJ. Maybe just let this one play out.
fo4bbpm	1587501394	Buccaneers	team	Never in my life I thought this could get better
fo4bbyw	1587501397	Patriots	nfl	Yikes
fo4bc8u	1587501400	Packers	nfl	Yay?
fo4bcc4	1587501402	Buccaneers	team	You beat me to it. I was literally thinking of this exact meme when the trade happened.
fo4bcfi	1587501403	Buccaneers	team	What the hell is 2020. Some person is gonna wake from a coma and wonder what the fuck happened
fo4bchh	1587501404	Broncos	nfl	Same same
fo4bcky	1587501405	Bears	team	No
fo4bcln	1587501405	Broncos	nfl	Im not gonna be the dumbass that says this is the end of the Pats til they actually have a fucking losing season
fo4bclo	1587501405	Bears	team	Bring Brate home. Naperville Central grad. Is also pretty good in the RZ and will likely be cheaper than OJ. Although Id love to have either.
fo4bcb8	1587501401	Chargers	nfl	Another 50 td season coming up
fo4bcc6	1587501402	Patriots	nfl	Branch was traded the year before Moss got there, and then was brought back after Moss was traded.
fo4bclk	1587501405	Patriots	nfl	People forgot his body was broken.
fo4bcok	1587501406	49ers	nfl	You could maybe make the case if youre talking about division rivals, or even a team you think you might face in the playoffs or something (since it could help them more than it helps you, so you net get worse vs. that one opponent in particular), but yeah, in this situation its an obvious win.
fo4bcjl	1587501404	Patriots	team	Yeah I think if hes healthy its a very poor trade. If hes not then its a free upgrade from 7 to 4. Dont like Gronks side of this tho
fo4bcod	1587501406	Patriots	team	Whys that
fo4bctv	1587501408	Buccaneers	nfl	Brate is the better all around player at the moment.
fo4bcv6	1587501409	Vikings	nfl	RTruth would like to know your location
fo4bcxj	1587501410	Saints	nfl	I agree with the first paragraph but Arm chair pyschology shouldnt be upvoted. You are just projecting
fo4bd0e	1587501411	Seahawks	nfl	Cant wait to see Tampa bay gronk lol
fo4bd34	1587501412	Patriots	nfl	leroy bomb
fo4bcft	1587501403	Patriots	team	It will be interesting to see if the year away did Gronk any good.  2020 Gronk might not be 2011 Gronk, but maybe healthy rested 2020 Gronk could be more effective than beat up worn down 2018 Gronk?Either way, since Gronk wasnt going to play for us, I look at it as we turned a 7th round pick into a 4th rounder, so good for us.
fo4bck2	1587501404	Bears	nfl	it has a lot to do that they tried shipping him out to die in god awful detriot, id be pissed to if i was gronk
fo4bcmp	1587501405	Patriots	team	The Pats turned their back on Brady first. Hes done nothing wrong in this. Gronk always said he would be fully done when Brady was. If you want to be mad at someone, get upset with Kraft and Belichick for letting the greatest to ever do it go with a sign on his back saying we dont need you
fo4bco7	1587501406	Packers	nfl	Why would you pick these guys? The Early 2010s Packers teams were pretty good.
fo4bcp8	1587501406	Patriots	team	Gronk wasnt cooked lol. He wasnt as good as he once was, but he was still a top 5 TE in the league easily.
fo4bcsm	1587501408	Seahawks	nfl	Boop for Leroy. Good boy
fo4bcvq	1587501409	Raiders	nfl	Wuuuuut
fo4bcw7	1587501409	Lions	team	Yea I dont really get the point.  If they dont want him coming inside what can he do in the driveway that he cant do from home?
fo4bd0z	1587501411	Vikings	nfl	Moss and Welker were something else
fo4bd79	1587501413	Patriots	team	Weve got 6 rings, we dont need 4 pants.
fo4bd7d	1587501413	Patriots	team	Hell put the weight back on.The year off is the best thing possible for someone who had chronic injuries like him.
fo4bdb1	1587501415	Ravens	nfl	Yeah Lamar fumbling nonstop is so frustrating. I get that they had to balance him somehow, but he fumbled like twice last year.
fo4bcop	1587501406	Falcons	nfl	Jameis was also way more mobile and could break tackles way better than Brady....just saying.
fo4bcqh	1587501407	Patriots	team	this is why you make 30k a year and others with real thinking skills make 100k.
fo4bctc	1587501408	Chargers	nfl	Better than any recent season in Bengals history?
fo4bctx	1587501408	Patriots	team	Thats true.
fo4bcvh	1587501409	Saints	nfl	Jameis was also getting eaten alive constantly behind that oline, Brady at 43 isnt gonna be able to take the same level of punishment
fo4bd02	1587501411	Patriots	team	Wow...you are a huge fan boy...Gronk is going to have to put on 50 pounds of muscle, and then regain his old form, just to be the best TE on Tampa.
fo4bd4i	1587501412	Seahawks	nfl	Wowzers Superbowl bound for real now!
fo4bd7y	1587501413	49ers	team	What are you thinking trading away our 5th round picks? Dont you know how to John Lynch?
fo4bday	1587501415	Buccaneers	nfl	Honestly I wouldnt even complain.
fo4bcyb	1587501410	Chargers	team	They defined almost the entire Rivers Era for sure.
fo4bdam	1587501414	Patriots	team	You know Tampa can just say no?
fo4bdgz	1587501417	Patriots	nfl	Groe Exotic
fo4bdtj	1587501422	Saints	nfl	A lot of SaintsLSU fans are torn about this...
fo4bd0t	1587501411	Eagles	nfl	Have you ever tried cte on weeeeed?
fo4bd2j	1587501412	Buccaneers	team	Brate 
fo4bd6m	1587501413	Bears	nfl	What is this, a crossover episode?
fo4bd8m	1587501414	Jaguars	team	While JK is a highly touted prospect, the Jags need a more complete team. The Chiefs got Williams off FA. The 49ers got Coleman and Mostert off FA. I would rather have a complete team than be the Carolina Panthers relying on CMC to do everything. We have a QB. Time to protect him and give him WRs. Find the RB to be his asset later in the draft. Cam Akers could probably be had Day 3.
fo4bdcr	1587501415	Vikings	nfl	That cross over will be awesome.
fo4bdf0	1587501416	Ravens	nfl	MOVE OVER, GRONK
fo4bdfh	1587501416	Patriots	team	Because he was on the retired list. His contract counted nothing against the cap
fo4bdlz	1587501418	Eagles	nfl	Come the fuck on our confrence is gonna be a fuckin blood bath
fo4bdmj	1587501419	Patriots	nfl	Tompa Bakowski
fo4bdtf	1587501421	Browns	nfl	Stands to reason lol
fo4bdv7	1587501422	Patriots	team	True. They have about a 2 year window to win a Super Bowl and its going to be very difficult for them to do that. You cant plug and play in the NFL like you can in the NBA. After these 2 years are over, theyll be back to the pits. They obviously wont have a dynasty like the Pats had.
fo4bdxj	1587501423	Patriots	nfl	Exactly
fo4bdeh	1587501416	Browns	nfl	yeah it does
fo4bdfn	1587501416	Bears	team	yea i think 7tenths is a fervent pace hater and will post in any thread how he needs to be gone
fo4bdn8	1587501419	Jaguars	nfl	I heard the Bucs want him!
fo4bdpk	1587501420	Rams	nfl	Nah. There was rumblings about a Howard trade before this Gronk news. Theyve got Brate as TE2, theyll move Howard for another piece. They need pieces in the secondarya running back.
fo4bdsa	1587501421	Patriots	nfl	2011 was deadly, but I still think this is better
fo4bdwn	1587501422	Patriots	team	Amazing how fast things change
fo4bdl8	1587501418	Steelers	nfl	Move falcons up to 2 for me. Except that weird gradient one
fo4bdvy	1587501422	Jaguars	nfl	There wasnt any cash in it when I found it, I swear!
fo4bdvz	1587501422	Patriots	nfl	Only if they dont 5th year him
fo4bdzw	1587501424	Patriots	team	LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO you were never a Patriots fan.
fo4be1l	1587501424	Eagles	nfl	The QB School.
fo4beem	1587501430	Patriots	team	I have a question for god why?
fo4bege	1587501430	Rams	team	Youre so cool.
fo4beiy	1587501431	Falcons	team	Brees still has nightmares about Debo
fo4bdwd	1587501422	Patriots	team	sad Edelman noises
fo4beff	1587501430	Patriots	team	Even if he was still best te in league he wasnt going to be here next year. So he would have stayed retired so think of this as we traded a 7th for a 4th and its an amazing trade
fo4behr	1587501431	Bills	nfl	Really? I wasnt sold on him at all honestly
fo4beml	1587501433	Giants	team	I picked Wills, surprisingly thought Thomas sounded the worse, like a Flowers.
fo4befn	1587501430	Falcons	team	Put it this way. I ordered a throwback rather than any of the new unis cause they all suckChargersBrownsBucsPatriots all have sweet new unis unlike our dumpster fire...
fo4beiv	1587501431	Falcons	team	Simmons would be the dream pick, but with what the bucs put together it has to be Simmons or CB.
fo4belr	1587501432	Eagles	nfl	Well this is surprising
fo4beny	1587501433	Jets	nfl	Says the guy whos team hasnt won a playoff game since 2000
fo4bequ	1587501434	Cowboys	nfl	Tony Romo is arguably the best QB in Cowboys history. He got a hell of a raw deal spending half of his career with a garbage defense, and the other half of his career with an oline made of swiss cheese. He put the team on his fucking back for every season we had a winning record. And that broke his back, literally.
fo4be8p	1587501427	Steelers	nfl	The Bucs werent betting against anyone else. Clearly Gronk was only going to return to play with Brady. Seems like fair value for both sides here.
fo4bejb	1587501431	Patriots	team	Apology accepted
fo4bek7	1587501432	Patriots	nfl	Bruh Im hip, I still dont think we see him take the field
fo4bew0	1587501436	Patriots	team	he always said he was gonna consider playing after resting a year. Not his fault belichick couldnt keep brady.
fo4bes2	1587501434	Buccaneers	team	Other than injury history and loss of prolevel conditioning idk what other reason you would consider to not bring back a future HoF TE. Id love to see him play again but I wouldnt hold my breath. He basically did this whole thing last year with the pats just to stay relevant on social media after retiring
fo4betl	1587501435	Patriots	team	OJ Howard probably going to the bears.
fo4bf0d	1587501437	Bears	nfl	Giving them Gronk for a 4th lmao
fo4bf28	1587501438	Patriots	team	He wasnt a top 3 TE in 2018 ( Kelce, Ertz and Kittle ), I highly doubt hes a top 3 TE in 2020.
fo4bf73	1587501440	Patriots	team	Being a great TE and being a valuable trade asset arent the same thing.
fo4bfhp	1587501444	Cowboys	nfl	He did, with a bonus star RB and then Dak showed up.
fo4beqp	1587501434	Falcons	team	Im honestly expecting Belichick to somehow end up in TB too now.  It was their plan all along. We better fucking knock it out of the park in this draft. Seriously.
fo4bewa	1587501436	Texans	nfl	Dont let this distract you from the fact that in 2020 Bill OBrien threw the Houston Texans off Hell In A Cell and plummeted 16 ft through an announcers table.
fo4bex1	1587501436	Packers	nfl	WE GOT OUR GUYS
fo4bf6k	1587501440	Patriots	nfl	Johnson did nothing and Edelman barely played.
fo4bfck	1587501442	Lions	team	Its Instagram, He had to go out of his way to make it his location and if he wanted it to mean hes just at his house he probably would have done his hometown
fo4bff4	1587501443	Giants	nfl	Going out on top
fo4bfoy	1587501447	Patriots	team	Jules gonna call up Belichick to tell him hes a cracker.
fo4bf6n	1587501440	Packers	team	Cherry (Starr)
fo4bfrc	1587501448	Buccaneers	team	Scumbag Bruce had no problems calling dumb plays for Winston and having a fucking RB in a wide receiver slot as the main target against Sherman. Had no problems forcing Winston to play with a shoulder injury at the end of the season and without his star receivers. Had no problems leaving him out to dry. Now he caters the world to Tom Brady.Fuck that motherfucker Bruce Arians. Fire his ass immediately if we dont win the super bowl.
fo4bfv7	1587501449	Patriots	team	Kill me.
fo4bfwp	1587501450	Patriots	team	What about the other side of the ball?
fo4bffx	1587501443	Colts	team	If they dont appreciate your presence, put them in the past and move on.Bet on yourself. Always.These things could be coincidence. Or they could be Hooker expressing his feelings.Now several stories break that hes been involved in trade talks. Im sure that trade talks happen all the time, but only a few of them get reported. If theres nothing to them, the organization usually quickly squashes the story.The Colts? We didnt call them they called us. Were only listening to offers.This is a nondenial denial. Its the kind of thing you say when you want other teams to make offers as well.What was the story about trade talks involving Jacoby Brissett after Luck came back from his shoulder injury, by way of contrast?Per Ben Volin of the Boston Globe, the Indianapolis Colts rejected an offer of a secondround draft pick from the Seahawks for the thirdyear quarterback. See the difference?
fo4bffv	1587501443	Buccaneers	team	I am cautiously optimistic
fo4bfqd	1587501448	Cowboys	nfl	rmadlads
fo4bfsb	1587501448	Cowboys	nfl	TBH, he should stay retired for his health. Hes a funny guy and could have a really great career doing anything else that is less strain on his body.
fo4bfvv	1587501450	Redskins	nfl	Not a fait accompli but if they pass on him, he could slip to the Giants 4. Best way to ensure he doesnt get to the Giants is to pick him at 2.
fo4bfxu	1587501450	Rams	nfl	Agreed. Theyre all top notch. My only little nitpick here is that I wish they had powder blue pants to go with them. Throw is some solid yellow socks and hot damn.
fo4bflu	1587501446	Seahawks	nfl	To be fair, they also traded away a 7th, so they didnt exactly trade him for a 4th straight up
fo4bfn4	1587501446	Bengals	team	Yeah I definitely dont think it should be a priority. We definitely are fine in terms of blocking for the position so the difference really is just what the coaching staff thinks about Uzomah and Samples potential as a passcatcher.
fo4bfpj	1587501447	Patriots	team	Brady wanted Gronk.  Pats had more leverage that this seems like Kraft doing Brady a solid.
fo4bfs2	1587501448	Saints	nfl	Dude youre fine. Bucs wont be that good. Only good thing on that offense is Evans and Godwin, and who knows how they play with Brady.
fo4bfwi	1587501450	Saints	nfl	Top 5 in TDS yet only playing 11 games lol keep saying that every year though I love it 
fo4bg5o	1587501454	Bears	team	Ill send you a moldy sandwich for him and a 7th
fo4bfpq	1587501447	Buccaneers	team	They dont have one already? Surprising.
fo4bfu6	1587501449	Patriots	team	His cap hit for staying retired and being traded is exactly the same for us as either way we owed the remainder of his signing bonus and thats it. He didnt have a 9m cap hit for us UNLESS he unretired and played for us(which wasnt gonna happen)
fo4bg5m	1587501454	Eagles	nfl	.....imagine if they also add AB
fo4bg8c	1587501455	Falcons	team	So a 40 year old QB and a year retired TE. I wouldnt go handing the division to the Bucs quite yet.
fo4bgex	1587501458	Falcons	nfl	cries in NFC South
fo4bgfu	1587501458	Chargers	team	I love you for this 
fo4bg0g	1587501451	Eagles	nfl	Wow already? Didnt realize that. Still there ring chasing this year.
fo4bg36	1587501453	Eagles	nfl	Remember all the Pats fans and Teddy Bruschi shitting on Lane Johnson for his comments?
fo4bgfo	1587501458	49ers	team	I fear we would have to send a lineman or a defensive player, since their offense is quite loaded as it is.
fo4bgfw	1587501458	Packers	team	This is exactly what I thought as soon as I heard the Gronk news. x200Bx200BPlease dear sweet baby Jesus!!!
fo4bgg4	1587501458	Buccaneers	team	this is real ? THIS IS FUCKINg reAL?
fo4bgj9	1587501459	Saints	nfl	Drew you can probably retire now
fo4bgmn	1587501460	Falcons	team	Brees still havin nightmares of Debo every night 
fo4bgnb	1587501461	Giants	nfl	This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them!
fo4bgqj	1587501462	Redskins	team	Mmm that would be overpaying Trent for Howard straight up or no deal. Trent is going to have a lot of suitors on day 2 and 3 of the draft
fo4bgsc	1587501463	Patriots	team	Gronk will be on for gronk plays, specific routes that him and brady have worked on for years. He wont be in a buc package im guessing their is just going to be gronk packs where they reuse some routes from the patriots.
fo4bg6g	1587501454	49ers	nfl	httpsyoutu.beGNCHuUtqpwE
fo4bgad	1587501456	Saints	nfl	This is your fault. Im blaming you
fo4bgag	1587501456	Eagles	team	Yes, rollover is added on to the cap. Its not a use it or lose it situation like the NBA. For this reason, looking at NFL cap space for a single year is very misleading. In reality, NFL cap space is more like a continual list. Every contract you sign counts against your cumulative cap space, forever.Scroll to the bottom page on Spotrac(httpswww.spotrac.comnflphiladelphiaeaglescap). Youll see that the 2020 NFL salary cap is 198 million, but we rolled over about 24 million from 2019, so our cap is 222 million for 2020. As of now, we are projected to have about 195 million in contracts for 2020 (not including rookies), giving us about 27 million in rollover for 2021. If we were to sign a player for 1 year, 27 million, then our rollover would be 0, which would directly impact our cap space for 2021.The closest approximation to expiring contracts is trading away future salary  a draft pick (similar to a longterm contract in the NBA, in both cases the goal is to save future cap space) in return for minimal compensation like a conditional 7th round pick (similar to a worthless player on an expiring contract in the NBA). The main difference is that in the NFL, the team trading the player away has to pay a portion of the guaranteed contract, so they cant completely shed a bad contract without a cap penalty. The team trading for the player often ends up with a decent contract with little guaranteed money, which is where the NBA comparison falls apart.
fo4bgbp	1587501456	Packers	team	Wow dont hate that Willis pick up at all. Former cane, surprisingly went undrafted last season after a ridiculous senior season
fo4bgd6	1587501457	Panthers	nfl	He is retiring now right?
fo4bgp5	1587501461	Bengals	nfl	Imagine Jameis as QB on this team. Bradys too old hope this backfires on them
fo4bgy8	1587501465	Patriots	team	I am really upset about this.
fo4bgzd	1587501465	Colts	nfl	Waiting for the first light of the third day
fo4bgcs	1587501457	Buccaneers	team	If the Bucs get Gronk, theyll be the luckiest club in modern time.  Before he retired, Gronks was broken in several pieces. The talent is still there.  Hopefully, hes healed.  And if he decides to come out of retire to play with Tom Brady, its gonna be something.
fo4bgo2	1587501461	Buccaneers	nfl	Its gonna be like one of those Bucks pregame rituals in the tunnel before a game
fo4bgqw	1587501462	Patriots	team	Yeah but Gronk probably would only play for Brady. He didnt play last year and is highly injury prone at this point. I also doubt he comes out of retirement.
fo4bgt7	1587501463	Buccaneers	team	Fire those link cannons my way!
fo4bh31	1587501467	Patriots	team	WORD!
fo4bgnr	1587501461	Chiefs	team	Or maybe, wild thought, he loves her
fo4bgoq	1587501461	49ers	team	
fo4bgos	1587501461	Patriots	team	Kittle is a better tight end.
fo4bgwx	1587501464	Chiefs	nfl	Mr. Backfield Cancer
fo4bgyd	1587501465	Chargers	team	Also, these are so unique, no one will be wondering who they are looking at.
fo4bh00	1587501466	Patriots	team	Whats your point? The Pats own his rights, he couldtcant just come back and sign with the Bucs.
fo4bh1p	1587501466	Colts	team	Hines is too. And while I am not Hines biggest fan...I could see Rivers wanting him to help him succeed.
fo4bh1z	1587501466	Patriots	team	The best part of the new uniform is the word PATRIOTS on the front. No one else has that.
fo4bh2h	1587501467	49ers	nfl	Hows everyone doing today?
fo4bh7q	1587501469	49ers	nfl	Hell be 31 by season start. I hope he does because when Gronk is Gronk, hes legitimately one of the most fun players in the NFL to watch, but we shall see.
fo4bhc0	1587501470	Patriots	team	a year off TO juice
fo4bhge	1587501472	Patriots	nfl	Yeah the choice was nothing or the 4th. All the fans saying they were ready for the ride to be over better not be bitching now. Im not pleased my team broke up like the fucking Beatles overnight but here we be. Ive been here since the beginning, ready to keep on watching. Maybe we get a baller documentary 20 years from now, but we all know that will never happen.
fo4bhh6	1587501473	Buccaneers	team	Shh, no, those words are cursed.
fo4bgxu	1587501465	Bears	team	Tbh if Im the bucs Id take rookie contract oj over coming out of retirement gronk any day.
fo4bh3w	1587501467	Buccaneers	nfl	Tom is a helluva lot more intelligent in the pocket. Ill take pocket presence over running around like a chicken.
fo4bh43	1587501467	Patriots	team	No I just think OJ Howard is going to get moved for a 2nd or 3rd and I would rather have gotten him for Gronk and a late pick than a random 4th rounder. I am stoked we got something for him, I just really wanted to go into this season with a TE
fo4bh6s	1587501468	Packers	nfl	Bro WTF!?
fo4bh85	1587501469	Buccaneers	team	Gronk is the WR3
fo4bh9k	1587501469	Redskins	team	The buccs already paid their LT
fo4bhc8	1587501470	Buccaneers	nfl	Just a nickname, unfortunately. Carnell is his actual name.
fo4bhd9	1587501471	Patriots	team	I didnt know high schools used our logo or any nfl logos. Kinda odd but Its been a while since Ive been removed from high school Football.
fo4bhfm	1587501472	Buccaneers	nfl	WHAT YOU GONNA DO BROTHER WHEN FLORIDA MAN RUNS WILD ON YOU!?
fo4bhg5	1587501472	Eagles	team	Lmao I Linc to this whenever I use coy on Reddit
fo4bhgq	1587501472	Titans	team	I still accidentally call it LP from time to time lol
fo4bhen	1587501471	Bears	team	We dont have the answer at QB on our roster. So lets take some damn risks and draft a QB every year until we do
fo4bhh0	1587501472	Patriots	team	We had zero leverage.
fo4bhiv	1587501473	Chargers	team	From the looks of it, theyre not shipping till September, so it would be ideal to wait if youre not currently working.
fo4bhmu	1587501475	Patriots	team	Lol traded him for a 4th rounder....looks like youre fucking delusional
fo4bhdm	1587501471	Cardinals	nfl	Youre thinking of the world selfish not stupid.  They are two completely different entities.  Maybe they think its stupid theyre forced to abide by these quarantine rules when most people dont even exhibit symptoms.
fo4bhg4	1587501472	Patriots	team	All that aside its like nobody remembers Tampa had a trash defense last season
fo4bhh8	1587501473	Falcons	team	I hope Simmons falls to 9th but I think the latest he falls is 7. Burrow, Chase, Okudah, Wirfs, Tua, Herbert
fo4bhit	1587501473	Saints	nfl	I was already scared of them for this season, and NOW THIS?!?!
fo4bhjj	1587501473	Giants	nfl	Eli finally left, so Brady can safely chase the NFC Conference Championship trophy to complete his NFL collection.
fo4bhs7	1587501477	Buccaneers	nfl	I will take all the blame.
fo4bi0f	1587501480	Jets	team	I read this in Lifeline from Apex legends voice
fo4bi4f	1587501481	Seahawks	nfl	Nah, man. Gronk wants a Patriots last dance.
fo4bi4w	1587501482	Bears	team	Send a 6th rounder and tell them they have to take Shaheen
fo4bhn2	1587501475	Colts	team	I hope the last person to leave New England remembers to turn out the lights at Gillette.
fo4bho5	1587501475	Bears	team	Dont the bears have a crappy oline to improve?
fo4bhs2	1587501477	Buccaneers	nfl	Gronk couldve just came out of retirement and fucked em... so yeah good on gronk.
fo4bi0k	1587501480	Bears	team	We live in a simulation
fo4bi35	1587501481	Patriots	team	Were getting something where there was going to be nothing. Its a net positive. Nothing less.Best wishes and good luck to Gronk in Tampa. Happy he could fulfill his dream and go play with Tommy one last time.
fo4bhna	1587501475	Giants	nfl	 A guy thats been dealing with injury for 4 straight years is probably never going to be healthy again.I wouldnt say never. You guys really didnt do anything to help him during those years either.
fo4bhy7	1587501479	Patriots	team	Patriots with better weather
fo4bii3	1587501487	Seahawks	nfl	Implying he doesnt already have one
fo4biki	1587501488	Panthers	team	Thats 3 awesome picks for Hurndog in 2012!
fo4bi9m	1587501484	Chargers	nfl	wait   what?
fo4bigx	1587501486	Giants	team	Man if you cant understand what my point was by me using the word good in the context I used it in, than that is on you my dude.
fo4bik4	1587501488	Lions	team	And all the rumors are that Miami doesnt want Tua either.So if youre, say, the Chargers, youre looking at the Lions, Giants and Dolphins before youre picking. If you believe none of those teams want Tua, theres no reason to trade up.
fo4bimb	1587501488	Patriots	team	I think top 5 is fair. Im hoping the year off helped some of his chronic injuries heal up a bit.
fo4bie1	1587501485	Patriots	nfl	Im not cool with this
fo4bik9	1587501488	Texans	nfl	And your NEEEEWWWWWWW 247 Champion TOM BRADY!RIP Howard Finkel
fo4bil6	1587501488	Ravens	nfl	Bro stop
fo4biwx	1587501493	Patriots	team	9 years and had 13 winning seasons (pretty decent, yes) but 8 of those (including hisThats crazy... So many players that need to enter. Are they going to go to 2 players a year at one point?
fo4bj0f	1587501494	Rams	nfl	No thats illegal
fo4bidi	1587501485	Seahawks	nfl	Who
fo4bidv	1587501485	Saints	nfl	You must be thinking of 2018. He won offensive player of the month in December last year
fo4bife	1587501486	Packers	nfl	WAITTHE PACKERS PLAY THE BUCS THIS YEAR DONT THEY FUCK MY FUCKING LIFE
fo4bin7	1587501489	Patriots	nfl	Yeah these are good.
fo4bipd	1587501490	Seahawks	nfl	Can someone explain how he was able to pass a physical in this time? Like one of the reasons the Seahawks havent resigned Clowney was because they couldnt evaluate him with a physical. So how were the Bucs able to give Gronk a physical?
fo4biqv	1587501490	Falcons	team	One of my favorite Falcons moments... the pick in the end zone. FTS.
fo4birv	1587501491	Patriots	team	If he came out of retirement before the trade then he wouldve counted against it, but we traded him before that. So I guess its better than him coming out of retirement and us not getting anything and having to cut him.
fo4biwf	1587501493	Lions	nfl	Bear TF Down
fo4biwt	1587501493	Patriots	team	Countdown til Brady forces the Bucs to trade for Amendola
fo4biyz	1587501494	Patriots	team	God can you not tweet that and embarrass pats fans. Just stfu.
fo4bj18	1587501494	Browns	nfl	Why would NE get anything? If Gronk unretires you cant afford his salary cap hit. So the Patriots literally have no leverage at all other than holding him hostage. And I dont think theyd hold one of their most legendary players hostage for that matter.
fo4bitf	1587501492	Buccaneers	team	Definitely the best
fo4bitq	1587501492	Rams	team	You said current rams and Jalen started 9 games, Rapp started 10. Not much different
fo4biz6	1587501494	Jets	nfl	As long as that bitch Carol Baskin leaves him alone
fo4bj5u	1587501496	Patriots	nfl	Even without Gronk hes still behind Cameron Brate who they already paid.
fo4bj6d	1587501496	49ers	nfl	If he keeps some weight off he could have a resurgence as a receiver.  He looked like he was moving in slomo the last year he was on the Pats
fo4bjat	1587501498	Chiefs	nfl	Talented is questionable at this point. Hes athletic for sure, but 3 years into his career hes been a pretty big disappointment. Youre looking at a mediocre tight end with one year left on his rookie contract unless you want to give him a 5th year option thats too pricey for the caliber of player he is. Thats not worth much.
fo4bj6g	1587501496	Buccaneers	nfl	Brady had a fucking ass oline last year and won 12 games.
fo4bj6k	1587501496	Patriots	nfl	we literally couldnt even bring him back, it would put us 9 million over the cap and that doesnt include the incoming rookie class
fo4bja9	1587501498	Patriots	team	awful take lol. 88? What a joke.
fo4bje4	1587501500	Colts	nfl	And shoulder
fo4bjir	1587501501	Buccaneers	team	HOLY SHIT
fo4bjq8	1587501504	Browns	team	Does anyone have the pro shop number? Just cancelled my Chub jerseys because I seen this lol
fo4biyg	1587501493	Jaguars	team	I would do Fournette for OJ straight up lol
fo4bj3a	1587501495	49ers	nfl	Witten 2.0
fo4bj5x	1587501496	Packers	team	This is setting up for a prime offensive draft. Wouldnt surprise it with the first 3 picks Gute goes tackle and receivers.
fo4bjmz	1587501503	Patriots	team	had a year left on his contract
fo4bjw9	1587501506	Bengals	team	My greatest accomplishment on this site.
fo4bjxd	1587501507	Buccaneers	team	Can OJ play right tackle?
fo4bjdz	1587501499	Packers	nfl	Remindme! 8 months
fo4bjqa	1587501504	Cardinals	nfl	Honestly I can really see them trading for Trent Williams and trying to make the cap work. They want a guy NOW who can just play 23 years at a very high level. OTs (even Thomas or Wills) will take at least a year or two usually before theyre solid dependable starters.
fo4bjq0	1587501504	49ers	nfl	Well, that interview went very well, surprisingly. They said Im moving on to the next round so lets see how it goes. It is more of a traditional project manager role, but for a good company though.
fo4bk70	1587501510	Eagles	nfl	Thats my point. I am shocked you guys got a 4th Id count that as a huge win. Tampa could have held out
fo4bk8g	1587501511	Seahawks	nfl	Fourth for a guy who probably will never play another game is SUPER solid.This seasons almost certainly getting canceled and hes going to have to retire without ever playing a down for TB.
fo4bjj9	1587501502	Redskins	team	No way if any picks are involved it would be on their end
fo4bjks	1587501502	Buccaneers	team	Exactly, Im putting the bad juju on them
fo4bjli	1587501503	Titans	nfl	Expect Jamies to bail out the defense.Thats no longer an option...
fo4bjlw	1587501503	Buccaneers	team	Thats fine, as long as its not Bill Belichick or Adam Vinatieri
fo4bjmn	1587501503	Patriots	nfl	No matter what happens, this is a great trade for New England.  We got a 4th for a 7th and a guy that was going to register 0 catches for 0 yards on 0 snaps in 0 games.  Belichick might as well have traded me to Tampa.If Gronk looks like he did in 2017, this is a phenomenal trade for Tampa, as well.  If he looks like he did in 2018, not so much.  If he looks like last year... ouch.
fo4bjn1	1587501503	Patriots	team	Honestly surprising that a guy like Gronk lasted under Bill for as long as he did. He and Brady are going to have so much more fun in Tampa with Arians.
fo4bjr4	1587501504	Ravens	nfl	Not a first but certainly better than a 4th. Just because gronk was retired doesnt mean he lost all value. He can easily be a top 10 tight end when he plays there is value in that.
fo4bjso	1587501505	Buccaneers	nfl	AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
fo4bju0	1587501505	Eagles	team	He knows he could take a steaming dump on the 50 yard line, and people would line up to get their picture taken with it, right?
fo4bjvq	1587501506	Patriots	team	Fuck it , Go Pats!
fo4bjz4	1587501507	Redskins	team	Montez Sweat was kicked off Michigan State, and we still traded up to draft him. Drafting a guy who, according to your quotations, rightfully almost left USC after they wanted him to switch positions after being a freshman all american (and a 5 star recruit at safety) doesnt scream character concerns, and in fact the second quote only confirms that they werent a red flag as Josh Shaw specifically said he manned up and apologized.
fo4bk0b	1587501508	Patriots	team	That trade values Thuney as the 22nd pick in the first round.
fo4bk3o	1587501509	Seahawks	nfl	He was a top 5 blocking TE too and he was 6th in yards after playing 11 games. He played 11 games and had those stats. If hes on the field hes gonna be good. Youre literally ignoring information to try and seem right.
fo4bk6x	1587501510	Giants	team	Im afraid to do a redesign after seeing what other teams have come up with.
fo4bkai	1587501512	Patriots	nfl	I have no hard feeling towards the Bucs so I think its going to be easy to cheer for Brady and Gronk
fo4bkf9	1587501513	Vikings	team	I feel like the guys who go in the mid rounds and have a best skill of route running are the ones everyone talks about 5 years later. Davante Adams, Michael Thomas, Diggs, AB, Keenan Allen, etc.
fo4bkfo	1587501514	Patriots	nfl	Hernandez was Travis Kelce before there was a Travis Kelce. Easily Hernandez
fo4bjss	1587501505	Patriots	team	lmao and yet here we are
fo4bk2v	1587501509	Patriots	team	Im sure you thought trading a second round pick for Sanu, drafting Michel over Chubb, picking JJ Williams in the second, and a undersized guard in the first round were good moves too. Well I guess when you have a casual fans, you dont face that much pressure
fo4bk6p	1587501510	Jets	team	Im from SoCal and live in the bay now. My dad grew up in SF so I wasnt allowed to root for any LA teams lmao
fo4bk9c	1587501511	Patriots	team	Man what did we do as fans to deserve this! Our heroes are gone 
fo4bkab	1587501512	Saints	nfl	WE GOTTA PLAY GRONK AND BRADY TWICE A YEAR NOW.
fo4bken	1587501513	Buccaneers	team	Youre wrong and stupid
fo4bkk7	1587501515	49ers	nfl	Credit to Leroy woof woof
fo4bkgc	1587501514	Cowboys	nfl	Exactly, I have his jersey somewhere....
fo4bkod	1587501517	Jets	nfl	The one team that beat them twice? Dont think its a big deal
fo4bku9	1587501519	Saints	nfl	Jared cook doesnt have a laundry list of injuries long enough to retire for a full season
fo4bkuy	1587501519	49ers	nfl	Agreed. I hope to see an America running on American electricity (WindSolarHydro) and manufacturing in American plants.
fo4bk9h	1587501511	Patriots	nfl	mouth agape
fo4bkah	1587501512	Dolphins	nfl	Who?
fo4bkbl	1587501512	Raiders	nfl	Melvin is a Bronco now
fo4bkd4	1587501513	Browns	team	Bruh every listing is like that
fo4bkdn	1587501513	Bears	nfl	Thats WWE 247 Champion Rob Gronkowksi
fo4bkgw	1587501514	Buccaneers	team	Lol are you insinuating he isnt gonna play? You think he just forced a trade for no reason? His agent just said hed honor his contract for the entire duration.
fo4bkhv	1587501515	Chargers	nfl	I understand the Chiefs stuff but an entire division can make the playoffs under the new format and wildcards have always been a thing, not sure why people take that into account so much. As for the Broncos hype, I really dont understand it. Lock is far from proven
fo4bkj3	1587501515	Lions	nfl	No one would willingly choose that.
fo4bknn	1587501517	Bears	team	As someone that wanted to draft Brad Kaaya in 17, my opinion means jack shit.
fo4bkwb	1587501520	Dolphins	team	Magic spot is 13. Im sure the 49ers would love some extra mid round picks over one high pick
fo4bl08	1587501522	Lions	team	He is almost like Slay (the age helps) in that everyone knows that Ngakoue will not play for Jacksonville.Slay would have played if he wasnt traded. Hes too old to miss a year, especially a contract year, and expect a big payday next year.
fo4bl48	1587501523	Giants	nfl	And if you guys somehow boost the offensive line and get another RB for the duo, jesus christ.
fo4bl4p	1587501523	Patriots	team	Really pessimistic that well even have a season, so theres that
fo4bkhr	1587501514	Cardinals	nfl	I dont know of any analytics people on YT besides PFF, thats more of a Twitter thing.
fo4bkl6	1587501516	Vikings	team	Sure but you take into consideration what your biggest needs are as well. I cant see a scenario at 22 and 25 where it makes sense to pick a WR when we should be building in the trenches. So not only are OLDL much bigger needs in my opinion, especially since we are a run first team, but corner is clearly a bigger need than WR. Not only that, but you also take into consideration what the talent dropoff is in later rounds. We can find a receiver in the 2nd or 3rd like Michael Pittman that would be a much more valuable pick than Tee Higgins in the 1st, for example.
fo4bkmk	1587501516	Patriots	team	Will this actually open up room in our cap?  Or do you mean we didnt have room in our cap even if he wanted to come back for NE?
fo4bkp2	1587501517	Patriots	team	Really interesting question. I dont know the answer. I love watching excellent football, so we shall see.I always liked Watching Russell Wilson and Pat Mahomes. Maybe Ill follow them? Who knows? For now, Ill still enjoy the ride with Brady.
fo4bkvc	1587501520	Saints	team	Obviously you dont hope people get injured, but hes gotta stay healthy that long. He retired for a year, looked skinnier, and we dont know of the injury comes back. Well worry about him when we face him, but I think its gonna take some time coming back to football form
fo4blce	1587501526	Eagles	nfl	Ill allow it
fo4bl1c	1587501522	Ravens	team	I know we cant use the Flying B, maybe it could be replaced with the frontfacing Raven used on the players hand warmers? Thoughts?
fo4bl70	1587501524	Buccaneers	nfl	Ive had my eye on him for a lonnnng time. Hes ours BOY
fo4bl9i	1587501525	Bengals	nfl	Buccaneers did a better job imitating the Patriots in 3 months than Detroit has done in 2 years.
fo4bldu	1587501527	Dolphins	team	Ive been conditioned to hate them for so long...its such a nice feeling this is happening outside of the division
fo4blff	1587501527	Patriots	team	LMAO.Mike Evans Chris Godwin Rob Gronkowski alone is good enough for 10 wins
fo4blfm	1587501528	Saints	nfl	Tampa Baytriots
fo4blhd	1587501528	Chiefs	nfl	With 6 more injuries lmfao
fo4blhu	1587501528	Patriots	team	This is not going to happen
fo4bli1	1587501528	Falcons	team	So just two more years and Brady goes away? I hope.
fo4bkz8	1587501521	Patriots	nfl	It does for me. Tom departure was obvious for a long time. I feel bad that Rob didnt want to come back for us, even if it was for health reasons, and now wants to play again. Thats all.
fo4bkzc	1587501521	Buccaneers	team	Its a crime I cant go on madden and play with Gronk on the bucs rn
fo4bl51	1587501523	Patriots	team	Okay. This made me laugh.
fo4blbd	1587501526	Patriots	team	why would they give us one of their tight ends when they dont need too ? You really expected the Bucs to give up one of their tight ends for a 30 year old hobbled Gronk coming out of retirement?
fo4blbl	1587501526	Ravens	nfl	Well... hes called the Garnet Thor for a reason. Whats Ojs nickname?
fo4blfb	1587501527	Patriots	nfl	People seem to forget about salary and contracts
fo4bljc	1587501529	Falcons	team	I respect that. Trading up does not seem necessary, but if a guy like Kinlaw, Henderson, or Chaisson isnt available by the 16th pick, there seems to be a significant drop off in talent based on our needs.
fo4bllf	1587501529	Chargers	team	Im pleasantly surprised
fo4bln4	1587501530	Colts	team	Jerry Hughes single handedly lost Peytons last game with us
fo4blrw	1587501532	Ravens	team	Thats gorgeous
fo4bl95	1587501525	Dolphins	nfl	Someone past 15 yards
fo4bl9z	1587501525	Buccaneers	nfl	eckfuckingcuse me?
fo4blbx	1587501526	Panthers	nfl	Imagine being a fan of team that in one off season lost their franchise QB, cut their fan favorite TE, and had their HOF MLB retire half way through his career.Then imagine watching the perennial bottom dweller of your, already super competitive, division build literally the football version of the Harlem Globetrotters. Just.... Hell yeah brother cheers from iraqcorona pls
fo4blct	1587501526	Cowboys	nfl	Shotgunning beers on the sidelines with BA after every TD.
fo4bliw	1587501529	Patriots	team	Patriots didnt really have that much leverage
fo4blkf	1587501529	Browns	team	What this all suggests, in reality, is that wed be perfectly fine selecting a guy like Becton at 10 who is already a great run blocker and needs to be coached in his pass blocking technique.
fo4bls1	1587501532	Lions	team	Aaron Curry4
fo4blt3	1587501532	Seahawks	nfl	Was it Gronk Flakes? Honey Bunches of Gronk? Rice Gronkies?
fo4blwg	1587501534	Buccaneers	team	Fire Them Cannons!!!!
fo4blz5	1587501535	Buccaneers	team	Not rn. Were shopping around two of our RBs for some picks bc late round draft picks are our thing
fo4bll7	1587501530	Raiders	nfl	Big hit for Patriots fans losing two iconic players to the Bucanneers, of all teams.
fo4blvq	1587501533	Cowboys	nfl	We already knew they were going to get some primetime to watch Brady. But they better do it before week 4 when he finally shows how much hes declined.
fo4blwv	1587501534	Patriots	nfl	Man who hurt you lol
fo4bm02	1587501535	Bills	nfl	Welker but yes this is the best offense (on paper) hes ever had
fo4bm8i	1587501538	Bengals	nfl	So, is this a calculated gamble, or do they know for a fact he is going to come back?
fo4blxj	1587501534	Eagles	nfl	Holy shit.
fo4blxn	1587501534	Patriots	team	Their defense is middle of the road
fo4blyz	1587501534	Patriots	team	Ill take things that could have been a comment on an existing post instead of its own post for 600 Alex.
fo4blzm	1587501535	Broncos	nfl	Damn Im praying this season starts on time. Go the fuck home, Covid19, weve had enough! () 
fo4bm09	1587501535	Chargers	team	Aye these are snapbacks!
fo4bm3z	1587501536	Lions	team	Mike ford is raw but has shown potential as a cb 2 after filling in as a starter due to injury. Maybe year 3 he takes a step? Eric schlitt has liked Mike Ford since he was signed as a UDFA
fo4bm4l	1587501537	Jaguars	team	Shes the hero we need right now
fo4bmav	1587501539	Patriots	nfl	Not a 4th, a move up from 7th to 4th.
fo4bmcw	1587501540	Cardinals	team	I live in San Francisco, I should still be able to get it right?
fo4bmdm	1587501540	Ravens	nfl	Marquise Browns Cousin
fo4bme6	1587501540	Texans	nfl	AB will be the next Tampa signing, calling it now
fo4bmfy	1587501541	Cardinals	team	For reference purposes(httpswww.reddit.comrAZCardinalscommentsbchz4aitskyler)
fo4bmi0	1587501542	Patriots	nfl	Free 4th Ill take it
fo4blvb	1587501533	Patriots	team	Im fine, doesnt make anything less stupid.Pats had his rights, he had to be traded, he couldnt just come back and sign with the Bucs.
fo4blx2	1587501534	Buccaneers	nfl	Faster release, better at reading defenses, better decision making, better pocket presence...all the things you need so you DONT have to break tackles.
fo4blxp	1587501534	Cowboys	team	Maybe its bias on my part but I think romo is truly one of the most elusive pocket quarterbacks ever. Of course not a runner like Vick but compare him to Steve young, Brett Favre, Roger staubach or russel Wilson and tell me he isnt just as good as them. I mean the dude juked out JJ watt in his prime with that spin.
fo4blyv	1587501534	Buccaneers	team	Only nude stripclub right? I tend to forget which one i end up in.
fo4blz8	1587501535	Patriots	team	Ive always been a true Brady fan
fo4bm9p	1587501539	Eagles	team	Then hed retire at least thats what Ill believe til it happens.
fo4bme8	1587501540	Buccaneers	team	You could actually get Gostkowski..
fo4bmhm	1587501542	Patriots	nfl	Dont you fucking dare
fo4bmhn	1587501542	Chargers	team	The yellow face masks are quintessentially Chargers but blue face masks do look tough though! The Old Navy color rush was a very bold move  they were already walking a fine line bordering on a college teams variation. Nonetheless, cool concept though!
fo4bmht	1587501542	Patriots	team	He wasnt even the best TE in the league the last couple years he played, Kelce was.
fo4bm6x	1587501537	Patriots	team	420 was yesterday bud
fo4bmch	1587501540	Packers	nfl	I really like that Willis flier
fo4bmv7	1587501547	Patriots	team	What a joke.
fo4bmbv	1587501539	Saints	nfl	Thats fair lol
fo4bmg7	1587501541	Chiefs	team	Had to give 2020 4th, 2021 1st  4th for the 22nd Overall. Fairytale scenario, but impact LBs like Queen dropping into the 20s is solely due to the positional value of this 2020 draft class. Now we only have to find a way to sign them!Let me know your thoughts.
fo4bmhc	1587501542	Patriots	team	You can negotiate. You dont have to accept the first offer given to you. Bill has been on a historic cold streak of drafting offensive players who dont play on the line.Itd be nice if our first year QB had someone to throw to outside of a 34 year old slot receiver who gets banged up every year.
fo4bmih	1587501542	Patriots	team	Thats the deal.
fo4bmms	1587501544	Seahawks	nfl	I feel it, but this isnt Gronk making some announcement or marketing its a legit trade so I thought it might have changed your outlook lol
fo4bmq9	1587501545	Patriots	team	OJ has been rumored to be traded since last draft. Id expect him moved before or during the draft
fo4bmxs	1587501548	Patriots	nfl	Honestly, brady never cared about rings, Super Bowl or otherwise
fo4bmyi	1587501548	Ravens	nfl	I really enjoy Brett Kollmans videos. I wish he did more of the a week because his videos have taught me so much about football that its made me better at madden. His in depth breakdown of offensive and defensive alignments and technique are really good. I also enjoy Jon Bois and his silly videos even though theyre less analytics and more statistics and weird history. But Brett could be a teacher of football, that guy has won me over as a life long fan. I hope his career evolves and that I can watch it.
fo4bmyp	1587501548	Buccaneers	nfl	Well, there was a Dolphins player that did once in the 70s.
fo4bmzg	1587501548	Lions	team	Miami isnt trading up as theyll be fine with either Tua or Hebert.   Lions will stay at 3 and take Okudah.
fo4bn05	1587501549	Patriots	nfl	Tampa Brady and the Gronkodile
fo4bn3z	1587501550	Giants	team	I think if they bring the throwbacks from the 8090s back, people would be happy
fo4bn68	1587501551	Patriots	team	I bet he felt like a fucking boss tweeting this
fo4bn7w	1587501552	Packers	nfl	what exactly would an overunder on that mean?
fo4bmpn	1587501545	Buccaneers	nfl	We have a young secondary but they really came on the second half of last season
fo4bmpy	1587501545	Steelers	nfl	If we could separate the 2 he would still be a steeler
fo4bmsl	1587501546	Giants	nfl	Beautiful kits though.
fo4bnes	1587501554	Buccaneers	team	We cut him and resigned him. Hes fine for depth. Cool it boss
fo4bmy6	1587501548	Buccaneers	team	This is a great trade for both of us. Gronk wasnt playing for Pats this year so we get a 4th for a 7th and you get gronk who could be amazing again who knows with a full year recovering will do for him.
fo4bn1e	1587501549	Packers	nfl	I still think he stays.  The return they would want and what everyone is willing to give are two different things.  Unless someone gets wowed by an offer, most players arent traded on rookie deals unless they were going to get released anyway.  Rookie deals are very priced very low and OJ Howard is being paid as the 36 TE and he is still giving them a better performance than that salary indicates.
fo4bn9h	1587501552	Buccaneers	team	Imagine a month ago someone said Brady and Gronk is playing for the Bucs
fo4bne8	1587501554	Ravens	team	OJ Howard is likely the one getting traded according to Bucs fans.
fo4bnf7	1587501555	Patriots	nfl	One the one hand I get to see Brady and Gronk play together again...On the other hand...
fo4bnn6	1587501558	Patriots	team	I, too, like bags of peanuts
fo4bnoc	1587501558	Patriots	nfl	In my mock I have the skins trading back out of 2 with the dolphins. Then moving back up with the Bucs for Williams. Skins get okudah(5), and chaisson(14) while the Bucs get Williams and Taylor (26). Wildly unlikely it works out exactly like this but I have had some luck in the past with bold predictions.
fo4bn67	1587501551	Lions	nfl	Hes probably not the one to go after then
fo4bnb9	1587501553	Patriots	team	They already did the trade. We got a 4th rounder
fo4bne5	1587501554	Cardinals	nfl	Maybe Strong Opinion sports and Brett Kollerman although Im not huge fans of them. Maybe not analytics, but KTO and Flemo raps are entertaining.
fo4bney	1587501555	Patriots	team	The use of CBD will definitely help with his pain management. Gronk never struck me as a guy who would want to pop painkillers his entire adult life.
fo4bnhj	1587501556	Lions	nfl	My wife and I (30M29F) live in the Bay Area. Im a software engineer and shes an HR manager at Facebook. No kids, own a house near UC Berkeley, fully paid off. 220kyr combined income. Fully funded emergency fund, 4 years of college expenses saved up for the kid we dont have and might not ever have, two 1995 Corollas as our commuters. I did splurge on a 2002 Ford Mustang last year, but the wife guilted me into selling it.Anyway, my question is this  my brother who works in construction making 30kyr has a sick wife and his car broke down. He recently called me up asking to borrow 1200. Should I completely disown him or just ignore his request?
fo4bnue	1587501560	Patriots	team	Has there ever been a post that aged like milk faster than this one?
fo4bnvb	1587501561	Packers	nfl	I dooo
fo4bneb	1587501554	Panthers	team	I thought so, Ive read that article 3 times now and unless Im an idiot and completely missed it, I didnt see his name once.
fo4bngh	1587501555	Patriots	team	I think... there might be other reasons
fo4bngi	1587501555	Patriots	team	Kittle and Kelce are definitely better right now than Gronk. Probably some of the Baltimore TEs also
fo4bnho	1587501556	Chiefs	nfl	Sexy Mahomes DOES make me harder...
fo4bnms	1587501558	Patriots	team	If anything it clashes less because this jersey actually has some silver on it.
fo4bns4	1587501559	Jets	team	I know Joe gets quite a bit of push back in this sub but I think hes one of the most pragmatic guys covering this team. He makes some cogent points about the state of this team this last decade  the offensive trend of the rest of the league.
fo4bo6u	1587501565	Browns	team	Are they staggering the auctions?  Only one of the Landry jerseys are available to bid on right now.
fo4bnnf	1587501558	Titans	team	In the other picture you can see the Red Man tobacco stash...
fo4bo5m	1587501564	49ers	nfl	Just let them know youre a talking tuna taco and 501 years old. They cant not hire you then
fo4bnvy	1587501561	Falcons	nfl	GRONKA BAY TOMPANEERS
fo4bo0o	1587501562	Seahawks	team	The missing piece to the Superbowl run
fo4bocc	1587501567	Patriots	nfl	Feels bad
fo4boh1	1587501568	Patriots	nfl	Brady I expect to perform more like 2018 than 2019. And he was still pretty damn good in 2018.Gronk is motivated, so I think he can still be a top 510 TE. From all the talk around his retirement it sounded like football not being fun anymore was a big issue. If the time off has let him rehab injuries fully, hes gonna be a monster. Even if hes not that effective receiving, hes a monster blocker and that was no different even in his last season.
fo4boh5	1587501569	Giants	nfl	Bury him. No mercy.
fo4boka	1587501570	Bears	nfl	Its been in talks for over a week
fo4bokm	1587501570	Steelers	nfl	PFT commenter called it two weeks ago through his dog leroyinsider. Schefter credited him. They talked about it on pardon my take. The past couple weeks and gronk mentioned Leroy on an ig live recently.
fo4bnt3	1587501560	Redskins	nfl	Bucs would have to include a mid round pick most likely, but I could see this happening
fo4bnu5	1587501560	Seahawks	team	The Seahawks didnt even have a selection lol. Also If the Ravens end up with two players called Lamar Jackson, that would be sick.
fo4bnxp	1587501561	Saints	nfl	R. Kelly might be a terrible person but dude can sure write some fire tracks
fo4bo2h	1587501563	Jets	team	is 30 the new 20?
fo4bo4g	1587501564	Jets	nfl	Did Bill inform patriots that he was always having a soft spot for Central Florida?
fo4boao	1587501566	Patriots	team	Well this whole problem is out the window now
fo4boc8	1587501567	Patriots	team	If my job already paid a six figure salary and together with my supermodel wife I was worth 800 million then I probably would stay where I was at because things were good, I had friends and the admiration of those around me and I was a key piece in the organization.
fo4bocn	1587501567	Seahawks	nfl	Has he passed?
fo4bod1	1587501567	Vikings	team	Amazing. Awe inspiring
fo4boiz	1587501569	Eagles	team	BDN will get the loudest cheers this fan base has ever given. And deservedly so
fo4bor8	1587501572	Saints	nfl	I mean... we still exist. The Bucs will be very good on offense but the Saints are much better in other areas
fo4bob8	1587501566	Patriots	nfl	Gronk putting a target on his back here... a lot of the NFC guys are gonna be gunning for that 247 belt.  Hell, Vita Vea might just sit on him in training camp to get the title.
fo4bogg	1587501568	Steelers	nfl	uSteakKnight look at this guy
fo4boho	1587501569	Patriots	team	ragedlikemilk
fo4bohw	1587501569	Patriots	team	What an idiot
fo4bon9	1587501571	Buccaneers	team	Cannons have been cannoned.
fo4bp0o	1587501576	Eagles	team	I hear what youre saying, I just dont think Gay Jr. is the player to break that trend for. He was suspended for cheating on a Chemistry exam and then again for getting into a fight with his teammate. His mental game on the field is suspect as well. One scouting report had him sounding a lot like Zach Brown in that he just freelances and leaves his teammates out to dry. Plus, hes predicted to go in the 3rd, which is still too valuable of a pick to throw away on a roll of the dice for a character issue player.
fo4bos3	1587501573	Giants	nfl	its even better.  You get the 7th not give it away
fo4boyb	1587501575	Patriots	team	Theyre gonna have a blast stacking Ls
fo4bp0t	1587501576	Buccaneers	nfl	Shit is going too well right now. Something bad is gonna happen.
fo4bp1f	1587501576	Lions	nfl	Well that was fast
fo4bp6e	1587501578	Buccaneers	nfl	HOLY FUCKING SHIT?! What world am I living in?! Please please please please please dont disappointment next year guys, like youve done to me every year!
fo4bp72	1587501578	Cardinals	nfl	Bruh steelers got Ebron.
fo4bpae	1587501579	Patriots	team	The Bellichick classic
fo4bon5	1587501571	Patriots	nfl	wtf
fo4botl	1587501573	Patriots	team	Glad Im not the only one who feels like this, since most seem pretty pissed out this.Gronk and Tom gave us the best years of their careers and multiple Super Bowl trips. They dont owe us anything. I just have a new second favorite team!
fo4bouf	1587501573	Ravens	nfl	But but... you guys are about to get clowney and have him opposite ends of Myles. We need firepower!
fo4bov4	1587501574	Panthers	nfl	Just means that well lose both games by 14 more points next year!
fo4bovm	1587501574	Buccaneers	team	You have RI flairAs a Pats fan from RI why is that not a thing even in rPatriots
fo4bow4	1587501574	Buccaneers	team	To think if the shit defense would have stopped Atlanta on 3rd and 15 in their own territory, we wouldnt have gone into OT that game.
fo4boy6	1587501575	Jaguars	nfl	Patriots trade gronkowski to Tompa Bay
fo4bp0g	1587501576	Saints	team	Same fuck Brian Kemp
fo4bp0u	1587501576	Packers	nfl	They could go 190 and still have the worst all time WL record, though.
fo4bp3y	1587501577	Patriots	team	Thaddeus Moss come on down
fo4bp4r	1587501577	Lions	team	Ya but remember the chiefs game? We thought we were good and ford field erupted. You put a team who can even whisper the chance of putting a playoff game there and the city will erupt.
fo4bpdn	1587501581	Buccaneers	nfl	How many strip clubs are there in the greater Tampa area?
fo4bpjf	1587501582	Seahawks	nfl	Why not? Ravens did it to great success, and its not like you want either of Gronk or Brate getting a ton of snaps
fo4bp1j	1587501576	Patriots	team	He did. Hes still banged up.  Having a very solid Brate with him will reduce his use a little, which helps him.  Id still take Kelce or Kittle at this stage.
fo4bp2u	1587501576	Patriots	team	Also their coaching staff. In my opinion, is nothing like it was here
fo4bp3j	1587501577	Chargers	nfl	The Colts hopefully. Rivers will turn him in to an all pro
fo4bp9h	1587501579	Titans	team	Just very nice dell curved ultrawides
fo4bpdt	1587501581	Patriots	team	420 was yesterday
fo4bpf3	1587501581	Texans	nfl	True, but Pats are SB contenders. Just got to get Brady a few weapons so you pay more for it. For a team very far away from the AFC title, a rental is less appealing.
fo4bppm	1587501585	Buccaneers	nfl	Fruity Gronkles
fo4bpai	1587501579	Lions	team	I predicted wed draft Amani. In the 2nd. Shows what I know
fo4bpcl	1587501580	Patriots	team	2020 is turning out to be something for sure.
fo4bpgj	1587501582	Bears	nfl	6
fo4bpsp	1587501586	Bears	nfl	Theres because cutler was out for a few games that year
fo4bpta	1587501586	Seahawks	nfl	He did just fine for those last two or three games.Fine.
fo4bpwm	1587501588	Patriots	team	Quit bitching people, this was the equivalent of finding a fourthround pick in your couch cushions.
fo4bpf5	1587501581	Ravens	nfl	GTA 4 offenseThe Cousins Brown
fo4bpfd	1587501581	Seahawks	nfl	One of rapaports tweets mentions that gronk has actually been adding weight in anticipation of playing. My guess is He wont take that many snaps and will be more like a 3rd downgoal line guy
fo4bpic	1587501582	Cowboys	team	Gronk went for a 4th, id say a 6th and a player, or 5th alone. Id do that trade, shit our 5th rounder this past year (Michael Jackson) isnt even on the team anymore. Id pair him up with Jarwin as TE2 though.
fo4bpjv	1587501583	49ers	team	Master(s) vs. the Apprentice(s) 
fo4bplb	1587501583	Eagles	nfl	catch me up?
fo4bpno	1587501584	Cowboys	nfl	Holy hell, thats going to be fun to watch
fo4bppe	1587501585	49ers	nfl	Woof woof. Remember to give boops
fo4bpq9	1587501585	Falcons	nfl	The dude obviously has a pretty serious mental illness though. Like I get hes an asshole but hes an asshole who is also mentally ill, compounding his assholeness
fo4bpqc	1587501585	Chargers	team	Custom might not be possible, at least through official sites. I know that with custom MLB jerseys, you cant create custom player jerseys of a player on a separate team.
fo4bpr7	1587501585	Buccaneers	team	Gronk in 2018 was a monster blocker and largely responsible for Sony Michels run where he didnt look like the bust he is. Also he came up clutch whenever we needed him to.Weed is now a thing in the NFL so I think we will see a better than 2018 Gronk. Worth 10mil no question.
fo4bprw	1587501586	Patriots	team	We didnt really have much leverage, Tampa didnt need Gronk and he wasnt gonna play in NE
fo4bps0	1587501586	Patriots	nfl	Trade already happened. NE gets 4th round pick. Bucs get Gronk and a 7th
fo4bps4	1587501586	Buccaneers	team	Nailed it
fo4bq0v	1587501589	Jets	nfl	What a great WWE career!
fo4bq96	1587501592	Titans	nfl	Which is why I said probably and not guaranteed, just was speaking of how highly regarded Tunsil was as a prospect.
fo4bpgr	1587501582	Eagles	team	I love you Nick, but we are gonna boo. Thanks for everything tho!
fo4bpzf	1587501589	Dolphins	team	Technically if Tua asked and Marino agreed he could wear 13.I dont think itll happen but it could.
fo4bqie	1587501596	Patriots	nfl	West Welker was so much better than East Welker.
fo4bpxi	1587501588	Patriots	team	I was always a Brady fan. Is that so horrible?
fo4bq5i	1587501591	Patriots	team	Now thats damning
fo4bq7c	1587501592	Jets	nfl	This is why Massachusetts is on lockdown
fo4bqh4	1587501595	Bears	team	So if Burrow falls to 42, we will give the whole house the next three years to trade up and snag him. Sounds reasonable
fo4bq31	1587501590	Bills	nfl	He played 13 games and was still the 12 most targeted TE in the league. Keep digging though because youll get there eventually
fo4bq6k	1587501592	Patriots	nfl	Perhaps, and it was a damn great run and Im glad to have witnessed it
fo4bq6p	1587501592	Cardinals	team	People who complain about hot weather are babies
fo4bq8u	1587501592	Browns	nfl	I mean thats what white people do when they retire?
fo4bq97	1587501592	Patriots	nfl	Even Belichick couldnt make the Browns relevant
fo4bqa6	1587501593	Colts	nfl	Sounds like some generic white dude from accounting
fo4bqby	1587501593	Packers	team	Sick play but comparing this to Cobbs return TD highlightas a rookie, its clear he lost a step.
fo4bqg6	1587501595	Colts	team	He hasnt played a single nfl snap. You dont know that. I think experts that study him for a living would know better, and if we draft him in entirely on the Hurts train.
fo4bqju	1587501596	Dolphins	team	Our defense would be too tired.
fo4bqog	1587501598	Eagles	team	Just like the Cowboys last year, at least we get to start out against three dogshit teams
fo4bqpr	1587501599	Patriots	team	You do know you can still be a Pats fan and support Brady and Gronk? See ya.
fo4bqro	1587501599	Saints	nfl	Why did Brady have to come to our division...why oh why...
fo4bqx0	1587501602	49ers	nfl	2019 Browns 2020 Buccs SB champs confirmed

fo4bqkd	1587501597	Giants	team	 You have LT 2.0 on the board.Delete this post before people see, you are embarrassing yourself
fo4bqmb	1587501598	Patriots	team	I just went out for a moment but then not only does Gronk returns... Hes traded to Tampa Bay!? What the fuck is going on!?
fo4bqig	1587501596	Dolphins	nfl	Pats got a 4th for a corpse, wtf
fo4bqpc	1587501599	Broncos	team	Our color rush literally looks nothing like the image on the right.
fo4bqsj	1587501600	Falcons	team	I think were gonna try and trade up for Okudah at 3
fo4br2a	1587501603	Packers	nfl	They couldnt of gotten Howard for picks???
fo4bqqp	1587501599	Vikings	team	Id trade Cook for any top 100 pick.
fo4bqwr	1587501601	Vikings	nfl	pretty bold statement, given the times we are in. The entire economy is in the shitter
fo4br23	1587501603	Patriots	team	We didnt have to pay him anything unless he came back to the league (correct me if Im wrong).
fo4br6j	1587501605	Patriots	team	We dont have to take shit from tb. We could just say thanks but no thanks. Gronk can play for us if he wants to come back. Its not like his cap is on our books anymore. We ate that last year. The only thing we have to worry about for his cap space is if he declares hes playing again, in which case we see the 9.5 cap hit.
fo4brbo	1587501607	Patriots	nfl	httpswww.espn.comnflstorypagehotread180105beginningendnewenglandpatriotsrobertkrafttombradybillbelichickinternalpowerstruggle
fo4brfq	1587501608	Packers	nfl	Really writes itself.
fo4bqur	1587501601	Raiders	team	Yup. Easy on the eyes too. Total dream girl
fo4bqwy	1587501602	Eagles	team	Well I believe his main point is not about the character issues..Willie Gay is still pretty raw on his game and skillset and we need a more mature LB that could perform instantly and doesnt make a lot of mistakes imo, for this year at least. Ill still be pretty hyped if we get him though, really great potential!
fo4bqxv	1587501602	Patriots	nfl	Edelman right now httpsyoutu.beoSKyaXkzVvc?t156
fo4bqyh	1587501602	Colts	team	We lost Ebro so it would be a great addition
fo4br38	1587501604	49ers	nfl	HES YOUR PROBLEM NOW YOU LITTLE NFC SHITS
fo4br50	1587501604	49ers	nfl	They just picked up Eifert though.
fo4brb0	1587501606	Patriots	nfl	Its like all my exes had an orgy with a single different dude.
fo4brnx	1587501611	Giants	nfl	Population you bro
fo4br5c	1587501604	Jets	team	Looks like Silverback said it above but its almost 100 certain a team like San Fran, Denver, or Philly put this out there in an effort to get teams to pass on him.
fo4brma	1587501611	Patriots	team	No, we are an organization that doesnt tank. When theres a Bill theres a way. Stiddy did great at Auburn. Give the kid a freaking chance.
fo4brn1	1587501611	Saints	team	Queen was really good in coverage
fo4brua	1587501614	Saints	nfl	And they dont stop comin and they never stop comin
fo4bryn	1587501616	Falcons	nfl	I dont know why youre getting downvoted. For once I agree with a Saints fan. Tom Brady is going to be 43 years old when the season starts. Bring it on old man !
fo4brlu	1587501611	Dolphins	team	SO.... When are the stories going to come out that Gronk didnt want to play in New England anymore?
fo4brt8	1587501613	Jets	nfl	Time to go watch the Winnebago Man videos on youtube again!
fo4brtm	1587501614	Patriots	team	We didnt lose gronk. He was already retired.
fo4brvs	1587501614	Patriots	nfl	Is it really just weed hes taking?
fo4bs1z	1587501617	Patriots	team	Im legit worried for Gronk and what he will do as Florida Man.
fo4bsbq	1587501621	Buccaneers	team	I swear to fucking god if he goes too
fo4bsed	1587501622	Patriots	team	if pats wanted howard they couldve gotten him. they chose to get a 4th rounder instead.
fo4brs9	1587501613	Cardinals	team	Ya thats the website, you should be able to order it
fo4brtl	1587501614	Patriots	team	Hes been putting on weight prepping to return.
fo4bs2l	1587501617	Patriots	team	they had some, dont need to trade his rights at all.  If he unretired they could still keep him off the cap by claiming no way to execute a physical.  he was not going to force himself onto the roster and end up playing again.  Tampas not going to want to carry those 3 so one is moving on anyway.  at least send a higher pic and get back into the 2nd round.
fo4bs83	1587501619	Patriots	team	Patriots fans are delusional
fo4bs9u	1587501620	Patriots	team	Hurts more than Brady tbh. This was sudden and unexpected. I had months to accept Bradys departure
fo4bsfz	1587501622	Patriots	nfl	He also might have needed a year off.
fo4bsgx	1587501623	Buccaneers	team	Im legit not, I only keep up with the offseason in passing. Also Gronk did this all last year with the pats just to stay relevant in social media so Im skeptical when he says Im totally returning for real this time lol
fo4bsmx	1587501625	Patriots	team	Yeah, everybody now confirming.  Hope it is at least the higher of their two 4th round picks
fo4bsqu	1587501627	49ers	team	Id be hyped if we managed to get him in the 5th. Id guess hes gone by the end of day 2 but hopefully Im wrong
fo4bss4	1587501627	Patriots	team	I legit want to cry (
fo4bstz	1587501628	Patriots	team	This better not be some Qanon shit.
fo4bsv2	1587501628	Saints	team	Probably, hes significantly skinnier for sure. I just remember losing my shit that game cause they legit looked like they just let him score. I was getting clowned hard by my friends when gronk dropped 21 pts lol
fo4bswl	1587501629	Patriots	team	But his injury history is still there, and hes now also a year older. Theres no guarantee that the year off will help him return to play at his previous level.
fo4bsx4	1587501629	Raiders	nfl	Dude could draw major heat
fo4bsx5	1587501629	Steelers	team	Counterpoint, they shouldve have canned Marvin Lewis years before they did.  The guy was there 16 years and made the playoffs 7 times.  Never won a SINGLE playoff game in 16 years.Did their ownership suck?  Yeah, but they had some players that couldve gotten things done.  Its not like baseball where ownership can actively destroy your franchise like the Pirates.  In the NFL, theyre all working with the same pool of money, salary cap, etc.  How he survived the first 8 years, only making the playoffs twice is beyond my ability to fathom.  He shouldve never seen the 2010s with that team, let alone being rewarded for mediocrity.
fo4bsyy	1587501630	Giants	nfl	This offseason has been bananas
fo4bt02	1587501630	Broncos	nfl	rrimjobsteve
fo4bt0w	1587501631	Patriots	nfl	Probably all the band wagon fans that jumped on once the Pats finally got good.
fo4bt2z	1587501631	Patriots	team	You think the Pats are going to do better than the Bucs?
fo4bshl	1587501623	Buccaneers	nfl	Yall are Schefter dickriders, he didnt even report it firstBut anyway  WE GOT HIM BABYYY
fo4bsjp	1587501624	Patriots	nfl	I have him going to the bucs in the 2nd round because I think it just makes too much sense for me.
fo4bsjr	1587501624	Raiders	team	lol this post is so dumb.
fo4bsmv	1587501625	Panthers	nfl	Lets not pretend our secondary wasnt already in danger
fo4bsr3	1587501627	Patriots	nfl	I hate 2020 so much.
fo4bsu2	1587501628	Bears	nfl	Once again, we are reminded that the Bears traded up to take Mitch with the second pick while Deshaun fell all the way to 12.
fo4bt1d	1587501631	Falcons	nfl	Its an interesting dynamic.I know they recently built some nice 500800K houses near my old middle school.I drive by sometimes and check the neighborhood out, because its some nice houses there lol.I also noticed that most of the residents are Asians and some Indians. When I say Asians, I dont mean your Vietnamese, working at nail salon type. I mean South Korean doctors and business owners type.I say that not to be demeaning but to point out a huge fact.Most of the people that live around that area are hispanic and black and the Vietnamese Asians.There are very few South Korean and Indian kids at the middle school and high school in that area.I know. I have family and friends that teach at those schools.So I ask a friend one time how come? Where do these peoples kids go to school?He said they probably go to private schools further away and their parents probably work further away as well.His point was illustrated when I saw a Congrats Grad banner in one yard during a drive. The High School was definitely not the local school. It was a private academy.x200BBasically, an entire group of upper class people moved into a neighborhood....and have little impact on the actual surroundings. Its crazy.
fo4bt7h	1587501633	Bears	nfl	Or his Irish cousin Jimmy OEdelman
fo4bt5l	1587501632	Bears	nfl	wtf
fo4btee	1587501636	Dolphins	nfl	I mean threatening retirement wouldnt have done much since he already was retired, he literally just wanted to come out of retirement if he could go play for the Bucs
fo4bthc	1587501637	Redskins	team	Josh Doctson absolutely shouldve been a first rounder. He had some elite film and wouldve been at least a passable pro if not for recurring injuries, which isnt something you can project at the next level, even if someone had college injuries.
fo4btip	1587501637	Colts	team	Ideally...Willis is a nickel S and the Colts have a pair that can cover deep.
fo4btj8	1587501637	Patriots	team	Well, its already done pending a physical. Gronk and a 7th for a 4th.
fo4btm2	1587501638	49ers	nfl	49ers
fo4bsyk	1587501630	Patriots	team	Meanwhile at Edelmans house httpsyoutu.beoSKyaXkzVvc?t156
fo4bszx	1587501630	Vikings	nfl	So if were doing meme trades how about obj to MN for a 3rd? Thanks guys
fo4bt3z	1587501632	Jaguars	nfl	We know
fo4bt5y	1587501632	Lions	team	Brown at 3. Its destiny. All of Detroit is pumping up the trade down so no way we actually do it.
fo4bt6s	1587501633	Chargers	team	Thanks for the heads up!
fo4btbe	1587501634	Packers	nfl	Mr. Big Chungus
fo4btcj	1587501635	Cowboys	nfl	Him making JJ Watt look silly and throwing a bomb of a touchdown pass is my fondest memory of this guy.
fo4bteb	1587501635	Ravens	nfl	This is, in my opinion, a much better version of the table because it levels the playing field.
fo4btgq	1587501636	Patriots	team	I shall call him Kevin Benjamin
fo4btq6	1587501640	Jets	nfl	im still not even convinced the pats wont be in the playoff mix, thats how traumatizing the last 2 decades has been
fo4btbw	1587501635	Patriots	team	You seem to know a lot.
fo4btly	1587501638	Jets	team	... are you serious? We cant get any free agents without horribly overpaying them and the team has been garbage for 3 straight years.  Players arent exactly flocking to come here, so I love seeing our QB get behind the franchise like this.
fo4btnz	1587501639	Seahawks	team	While Singletary looked like an above average running back I disagree with just about every other running back you mentioned. Mattison couldnt beat out Mike Boone when Dalvin Cook got injured, so I have no clue what you were watching. Sanders was nothing special and Pollard did well but also nothing above average. I wasnt comparing Jacobs and Homer, I was just pointing out that good running backs  wins. The problem down the stretch last season wasnt who was carrying the ball, it was that we repeatedly took the ball out of our best players hands and put him in situations where he had to bail us out time and time again.Im not saying that Homer is better than any of those guys, Im saying that having them would it have won us any more games last season. This is because running backs have marginal impact on team success.
fo4btjq	1587501638	Titans	nfl	1,402
fo4btvf	1587501642	Broncos	nfl	Well it seems like if that was the only thing, he would have tried to make an actual comeback last season or he wouldnt have even retired at all. He wants to play with Brady, but it definitely seems like he didnt want to play in NE
fo4bu0b	1587501644	Bengals	team	No. Next question.
fo4bu82	1587501646	Steelers	nfl	The come up
fo4btme	1587501638	Saints	nfl	AND TODD GURLEY (lol)
fo4btn1	1587501639	Patriots	team	Imagine thinking anyone here would care. Especially today.
fo4btoq	1587501639	Patriots	team	Feelsbadman
fo4btvb	1587501642	Seahawks	nfl	I mean with the amount of punishment his body has taken he is for practical purposes at least like 35
fo4buaa	1587501648	Ravens	nfl	Oh the NFC south is getting Flaming Hot spicy 
fo4buax	1587501648	Patriots	team	Who cares
fo4bugl	1587501650	Bears	team	When Oklahoma needed Hurts to make plays against LSU he put up  1531 217 yds 0 TDs and 1 INT.  Oklahoma was getting stomped and he couldnt even put up a TD in garbage time.After already drafting Mitch who has problems reading the defense and making  accurate throws, I do not want another QB who has issues reading defenses and bails out with this legs. No thank you
fo4buhh	1587501650	Lions	nfl	Im not saying your wrong at all but thats not the best source. Mocks have been wrong for a majority of those time periods the past two years on No. 1 overall.
fo4btte	1587501641	Ravens	team	Whats the story on that? Why cant we use the flying B logo?
fo4bty8	1587501643	Packers	team	Landon Collins bro! Had no idea he was still kicking around lol.
fo4btzb	1587501644	Browns	nfl	Which team are you hopping fandom to next?
fo4buct	1587501648	Cardinals	nfl	Fair. I could be totally wrong lol well see
fo4budv	1587501649	Patriots	team	This is dumb. Bill has won 8 Superbowls and finished in 2nd 4 other times. Bill is still the best coach in the league. To say anything otherwise is straight up nonsense.
fo4bull	1587501652	Patriots	team	I fully expect 2020 to hurt me some more, but not like this
fo4bums	1587501652	Patriots	team	For any team but one team...Think of that bargaining position....you got a 4th for a retired TE to trade him to the only team he said he go to, to get a 4th out of that is very good
fo4buox	1587501653	Dolphins	team	I heard he didnt even tell anyone he just dipped out in a jet.
fo4buqr	1587501654	Patriots	nfl	I was hoping for OJ and a 4th or a 2nd just because Bucs have gone win now and was hoping theyd overpay but this is acceptable considering he wasnt going to come out of retirement for us and if he really wanted to could have forced us to release him instead so better than nothing.
fo4bu7j	1587501646	Vikings	team	And Bush didnt do 911
fo4bu90	1587501647	Eagles	nfl	So you invite them in to talk.. things escalate and you end up jumping right back into an extremely toxic relationship that last for a few months before ending the same way it ended the previous time
fo4buf9	1587501649	Bears	team	DB early, Starting CB or S in 2nd.
fo4burz	1587501654	Patriots	nfl	The funniest part of this is that the bucs flavors are like the least represented in this thread
fo4bux4	1587501656	Patriots	team	I concur. Gronks back, neck and knees are made of prayer and balsa wood and Tampa knows this. Im not slagging Gronk since when healthy, he is still a real weapon for Brady, and defenses will have to adjust in a way that creates favorable matchups across the field, but hes not the same guy he was in NE.And its very unlikely that Tampa (read Brady, because hes calling the shots) wants to give up a valuable second TE option in OJ Howard either. Think of how deadly TB was with Gronk and Hernandez, but now measurably slow both Brady and Gronk down, and you can see Howards prospective importance. Taking away TE tools is NOT peak Brady. My uneducated guess is that Tampa parts with a third round pick and possibly swaps a fifth. And you can bet then on two things BB will package a third or two to go shopping, and that whatever he does bring in, 98 of rPatriots, myself included, will be caught off guard.
fo4buyb	1587501656	Patriots	nfl	Do they have Dunkin donuts in Florida?
fo4bv1n	1587501658	Raiders	nfl	Moooooom... whos the guy shitting in our bushes?
fo4bure	1587501654	Vikings	nfl	No, keep your shitty TEs...Sharron doesnt throw to them anyway.
fo4bus9	1587501654	Browns	nfl	OH, THEY FOCKIN
fo4bv33	1587501658	Bengals	team	No
fo4bv3l	1587501658	49ers	nfl	Idk, if youre telling me some hot head 25 year old in the 80s that knows he can do blow whenever and still compete at a high level and make millions...wouldnt do it throughout their career...there are so many untold stories from there players..80s was a different time and you can get away with stuff...now its almost impossible to not get caught and have it spread like crazy through social media
fo4bv5a	1587501659	Packers	nfl	Rtruth attacks gronk mid game, Vince McMahon music plays through the loud speakers and he struts down the field the camera pans to gronk who rips his jersey to reveal an XFL jersey.
fo4bup4	1587501653	Patriots	team	Flying Elvis sells. The color silver doesnt.
fo4buql	1587501653	Chiefs	nfl	That and the Ward his are the biggest shots I have ever seen on Gronk.
fo4bury	1587501654	Browns	nfl	What about on the field though?  Cant tackle or block someone without getting their faces.
fo4buu5	1587501655	Dolphins	team	I like the taste, its just too chewy for me. Good steak is good, but give me ground beef over mediocre steak any day.
fo4buvo	1587501655	Patriots	team	Even a broken down gronk is still top 10 assuming hes on the field. Whole lot better than Matt Lacosse.
fo4buzn	1587501657	Patriots	team	Ik that Im just saying, should we tank
fo4bv4q	1587501659	Bears	team	Gronk and a 7th got a fourth rounder. Lets give them Shaheen and a sixth.
fo4bv5o	1587501659	Falcons	nfl	Its our lot in life.At least you can cry into your LombardiGod damn it why couldnt we have just won that fucking super bowl
fo4bv79	1587501660	Bills	nfl	HOW DOES IT FEEL FUCKERS. FEELS PRETTY GOD DAMN BAD DOESNT IT HAHAHAHAHAH
fo4bvf3	1587501663	Patriots	nfl	I think it is equally hilarious tbh
fo4buye	1587501656	Chiefs	nfl	Dolphins are going to be the best team in the division next year. You heard it here first.
fo4buze	1587501657	Patriots	team	Interesting considering everyone seems to be anointing Howard as the next great TE.
fo4bv1j	1587501657	Cardinals	nfl	Also places with meth
fo4bv6r	1587501659	Patriots	team	Thanks
fo4bv7j	1587501660	Patriots	nfl	He didnt finish his contract so they still owned the rights to his final year.
fo4bv8a	1587501660	Patriots	team	Usually in a cap dump, the team gains cap back as part of the dump. We gained 0.
fo4bvg7	1587501663	Bengals	nfl	Excuse you?
fo4bvh1	1587501664	Seahawks	team	You laugh now, but just you wait until Pete DB Whisperer Carroll gets his hands on him.
fo4bvlc	1587501665	Patriots	team	Theyre going to be a good team this year. Solid young defense and will likely use 14 on an offensive lineman. Definitely will be competitive
fo4bvnd	1587501666	Giants	team	I feel like you are trying to convince yourself Simmons is the guy. Saquon and DJ were obvioushighly rumored picks before the draft came about. People just assumed DJ would be picked at 17 or just didnt choose to believe it at all.
fo4bv74	1587501660	Patriots	team	He was an elite blocker his last season with us and he still put up 700 yards while hobbled. If hes recovered hes in the convo. If he hasnt hes still a top 5 TE.
fo4bva6	1587501661	Colts	nfl	When you say KTO and Flemlo, you also have to say UT
fo4bvaq	1587501661	49ers	team	This will be his 3rd season correct? I
fo4bvbi	1587501661	Ravens	nfl	Yes. Literally everyone who isnt a Pats fan is eagerly awaiting the collapse of the Patriots dynasty. Hoping the fall to the bottom of league never to return. Kind of like the Romans did.
fo4bvcx	1587501662	Bengals	team	I wouldnt say just as
fo4bvm9	1587501666	Buccaneers	team	Fuck Dante Wesley!
fo4bvqt	1587501667	Patriots	nfl	Bro
fo4bvse	1587501668	Patriots	team	Damn Gronk really must have hated it here to retire and then ask to be traded
fo4bvtu	1587501669	Giants	team	ADCB
fo4bvxn	1587501670	Cardinals	nfl	People are just listing tape breakdown channels,  which are okay, but not really analytics. The only semimajor analytics channel on YouTube would be PFF, but even then a lot of their most interesting stuff is on their websitetwitter.If you want to dive into advanced analytics for football, stick to twitter imo
fo4bva9	1587501661	Chargers	nfl	He tried out wrestling and is moving on
fo4bvbr	1587501662	Buccaneers	team	ALL ABOARD THE BANDWAGON
fo4bvtg	1587501668	Saints	nfl	DONT REMIND ME. Wtf happened to our division 
fo4bvkn	1587501665	Packers	team	Id have to think if we were going to trade for him itd be done already.
fo4bvmc	1587501666	Patriots	team	This is a really salty tweet... Ew.
fo4bvr8	1587501667	Buccaneers	nfl	Maybe we trade for Goodwin..just need everyone to stay healthy and thatd be the great set of skill position players ever.
fo4bw0c	1587501671	Patriots	team	I mean, have you seen how little cap space the Patriots have? I agree its frustrating, but Im not sure what they couldve done to really make an impact.
fo4bw2k	1587501672	Buccaneers	nfl	Around my house we call him Big dumb fucking idiot who volleyballs the football into the arms of defenders.Still waiting for it to catch on nationally.
fo4bw4r	1587501673	Browns	nfl	People with the injury history Gronk has dont ever get healthy. He might feel ok right now, but make no mistake his body is broken.
fo4bvqw	1587501667	Browns	nfl	What the actual fuck. Holy shit. Thats some nice value for you guys.
fo4bw07	1587501671	Raiders	nfl	There it is boys
fo4bw3k	1587501672	Bears	nfl	Ah, I see youre the type of fan who defends his won dumb idea by referencing something a team I root for did. Intelligent!
fo4bw45	1587501673	Lions	team	Ya but remember the chiefs game? Ford field was going nuts. We thought we were good and thats not something we think to often. We are all like old grandpas who just watch the team lose and lose and lose. But u put a playoff game in detroit and just watch.
fo4bw94	1587501675	Patriots	team	I know someday is going to happen, as it did with Brady, Gronk, etc, but jesus this is happening too fast.
fo4bwbs	1587501676	Cowboys	nfl	Nah man I get it.  As im finding out with the last dance I will argue with people like my life depends on it about my GOAT.
fo4bw32	1587501672	Saints	nfl	Falcons fans, truce? We have new enemy now.
fo4bw85	1587501674	Eagles	team	How would empty stadiums be an advantage for us? Our home field advantage is one of the best in the league, opposing teams hate playing at the Linc.
fo4bwfx	1587501677	Eagles	nfl	They own his rights
fo4bwle	1587501679	Chiefs	nfl	I really dont think so. I think the dolphins would have built a play action heavy offense built around Ronnie Brown to try and emulate what Brees did in San Diego with LT. His offensive coordinator was mike mularkey who was running that kind of offense an entire decade later. I think that projecting Brees to become what he did without payton is wholly unrealistic.
fo4bw5l	1587501673	Bengals	team	slap the big B logo on both sides and Im in!!!!!!
fo4bwom	1587501681	Jets	team	Together with our Quarterback, we ride off into the SUPERBOWL SUNSET
fo4bwtu	1587501683	Packers	nfl	I remember the good old days when these guys were in the AFC
fo4bwdw	1587501676	Buccaneers	team	Oh sorry, well In that case yeah its official. Congrats! Brady and Gronk are gonna be fun to watch again with those other weapons you guys have
fo4bwfi	1587501677	Seahawks	nfl	Can confirm, I even sent one
fo4bwmk	1587501680	Jaguars	team	Absolutely.
fo4bwqo	1587501682	Patriots	team	Im down, if we can get him by going 412 fuck it. Ill swallow that.
fo4bx0s	1587501685	Buccaneers	nfl	Dude, you cant get suspended for weed anymore. It wouldnt matter.
fo4bx3e	1587501686	Patriots	team	Fuck off
fo4bx6m	1587501688	Ravens	team	Have you seen Brates contract?!? No thanks.
fo4bx7z	1587501688	Patriots	nfl	LET THIS END
fo4bwkl	1587501679	Patriots	team	Prob trade Bill to the bucs for Brady now.
fo4bwl0	1587501679	Bears	nfl	Howard gonna be gone
fo4bwp2	1587501681	Broncos	nfl	rrimjobsteve
fo4bwsl	1587501682	Patriots	nfl	He looked great in the 2018 playoffs, he just got tired of BBs style unfortunately
fo4bwtd	1587501682	Chiefs	team	Hes a one year wonder I wouldnt be giving up future picks for someone who is so raw  in a position we are not very deep in
fo4bwwc	1587501684	Panthers	nfl	Trading Howard and change for Trent Williams would be huge.
fo4bwwp	1587501684	Bears	nfl	Well see, Brady is getting a massive upgrade in receivers. Im sure gronks heart and mind are in it, but I really dont know if his body is.
fo4bwzs	1587501685	Steelers	nfl	Lol the dude who kept AB under wraps for years despite ha ing other teammates talk shit about him is weak?
fo4bx8g	1587501688	Seahawks	team	Im guessing this is to bring competition to the nickel spot.  Dont know anything about this guy but hes got 29 inch arms so I doubt Pete would want him on the outside.
fo4bx8t	1587501688	Packers	nfl	Oh frig off Ricky
fo4bxc8	1587501690	Seahawks	nfl	He was the 12th most targeted TE and had top 6 yards when he played. Sounds like a top 10 TE to me. Youre obviously just the type of person who wont admit theyre wrong. In the time he played hes obviously a top 10 TE.
fo4bx42	1587501687	Patriots	nfl	Gordon already left champ
fo4bx5g	1587501687	49ers	nfl	Jags signed Eifert in FA, you think they give up Fournette for another TE or try to get someone else that can plug another hole?
fo4bx86	1587501688	Browns	team	Hes a suitor.
fo4bxim	1587501692	Redskins	team	We needed Defense and had DJax and Garon. Just admit it was a bad pick.
fo4bxmv	1587501694	Falcons	team	Derrick Brown, Tua Tagovailoa, and Jedrick Wills could all be added into that group too. If the Giants, Chargers, and Panthers dont pick him, and we strike a trade with Jacksonville, hes ours.
fo4bx2l	1587501686	Saints	nfl	I think your offense is still better
fo4bx2p	1587501686	Dolphins	team	They used to be way better. Now they kinda suck.
fo4bx4x	1587501687	Titans	nfl	But all threatening retirement does is give pats leverage if theyd rather keep him retired than take a bad deal. Shows they wont be taken advantage of. If he retires, no cap hit
fo4bx8q	1587501688	Saints	nfl	WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS
fo4bx9q	1587501689	Cowboys	nfl	Wasnt Dabo right about Deshaun, Deshauns a winner, put him on the chiefs and mahomes on the texans with that garbage o line and only 1 receiving threat because everyone else is injured and i dont think mahomes even does what deshaun been able to do ad deshaun has a ring. Texans finally have an elite qb, just a shame BOB traded away their future. deshaun makes plays i cant see anyone else doing
fo4bxg9	1587501691	Cowboys	nfl	WHAT THE FUCK I SAW THIS ON SOMEONES INSTAGRAM STORY AND THOUGHT IT WAS A JOKE LMAO
fo4bxhf	1587501692	Cowboys	nfl	He has traded his car and his laptop for 15 minutes in a locked room with Jimmy G and an NDA. We are legitimately unsure how bad of a trade that is at this time.
fo4bxjr	1587501692	Eagles	nfl	This lineup is way better than the Eagles embarrassing Dreamteam.
fo4bxnk	1587501694	Patriots	nfl	Andre Gurode That was calculated
fo4bxo3	1587501694	Dolphins	team	How about we address safety, since we already signed THREE pass rushers
fo4bxrh	1587501695	Falcons	nfl	How the heck will a 43 year old man keep his shoulder healthy? Avocado ice cream or something? Sleeping beside a super model ? Stop.
fo4bx8n	1587501688	49ers	team	I bet LA will.  They wont want to pay him.
fo4bx9i	1587501689	Lions	team	I like Davon Hamilton there
fo4bxa8	1587501689	Buccaneers	team	Good call, also those comments are ragedlikemilk material
fo4bxcj	1587501690	Saints	team	Bring it on. Cant wait to beat the Bucs.
fo4bxh8	1587501692	Rams	nfl	I guess we find out for real who is more valuable Brady or Belicheck.
fo4bxje	1587501692	Patriots	team	Still pressing X?
fo4bxob	1587501694	Patriots	team	The what now
fo4bxwy	1587501698	Giants	team	Aight
fo4bxxq	1587501698	Texans	team	Its not a position of need and we cant afford getting rid of any more draft picks. This wouldnt make sense even for BOB.
fo4by19	1587501699	Buccaneers	team	Which one of our 4th?
fo4by4k	1587501701	Broncos	nfl	Not surprising at all lol
fo4bxtn	1587501696	Patriots	nfl	Gronk is an inner circle HOFer with 3 rings already. He and Lane arent in the same universe
fo4bxuk	1587501697	Eagles	nfl	Isnt that what they usually say? Coming from a guy whos team has no secondary lol
fo4by2b	1587501700	Seahawks	team	Biggest transaction of the day
fo4bxz0	1587501698	Jets	nfl	Your team lets their players murder people so maybe glass houses bro.
fo4by0f	1587501699	Patriots	team	No
fo4by1s	1587501700	Patriots	nfl	Real original, I just went grocery shopping so I have something for you to wear over your head
fo4by53	1587501701	Patriots	team	We will have better odds at winning our division though.  Yes the Bills will be a challenge but we still have the jets and the fins.  Bucs got the Saints who are arguable equally or slightly more talented with years more experience together working as a unit.  That being said I think both Pats and Bucs make the playoffs and both are out within the first 2 rounds
fo4by7l	1587501702	Patriots	team	Nothing wrong with just following players you like if thats your thing. At the end of the day, its just entertainment.  Kind of weird that you felt the need to tell us though to be honest.
fo4by7g	1587501702	Patriots	team	I was accurate, so yeah.
fo4by8a	1587501702	Patriots	team	Gronk. Lol. For what the first 3 games? 7 catches for 40 yards then he hurts his shoulder. Do you forget how fragile gronk is, especially with a new group of players that never got to him before, they will say they took down one of the greatest TE in nfl history. He also hasnt played football in over a year so he is very much out of football shape, did you see the weight he lost? This is not 2016 Gronk.
fo4by8s	1587501702	Patriots	team	Cause no one watches him play
fo4bxzm	1587501699	Steelers	nfl	I dont blame them either. Youve got TB12 coming to town, shoot your damn shot.
fo4by0r	1587501699	Buccaneers	nfl	Im excited to finally buy a madden game this year.
fo4by1b	1587501699	Jets	nfl	I got news for you buddy
fo4byfu	1587501705	Packers	nfl	Could you fucking imagine?
fo4bygt	1587501705	Patriots	team	I am so fucking mad
fo4byl8	1587501707	Jets	nfl	GRANNY, NO!
fo4bym1	1587501707	Bears	nfl	No us
fo4bymq	1587501708	Ravens	nfl	What, what? Gronk retired, how are the Patriots trading him?
fo4bynr	1587501708	Ravens	nfl	Ive been predicting it since week 12 of last season. Think theres a pretty legitimate chance we sign him.
fo4byqa	1587501709	Patriots	nfl	I will literally pay someone 5 cents to come over to my house right now and shoot me in the head
fo4byef	1587501704	Patriots	team	This probably wasnt the first offer.Why would Tampa offer anything of value if they dont have anybody competing with their offer and they dont really need him? Id be willing to bet that bringing in Gronk is more of a courtesy to Brady than it is a roster improvement thing.Bill had no negotiating power.
fo4byou	1587501708	Packers	team	That would be pretty good.
fo4byql	1587501709	Bengals	team	Im more likely to sleep with Florence Pugh than the Bengals are to pass on Burrow.
fo4bycn	1587501704	Patriots	team	Yeah that is why I am confused. I cant imagine that a 4th rounder would have the same impact as a TE to this team.
fo4bymn	1587501708	49ers	nfl	Just imagine the 49ers in two TEsets
fo4byw9	1587501711	Broncos	team	You couldve just put a traffic cone and it wouldve worked.
fo4bz14	1587501713	Chargers	team	Am I the only one that isnt crazy about the yellow pants with the powder blue?
fo4bz5e	1587501714	Buccaneers	team	You hate to see it
fo4byek	1587501704	Buccaneers	nfl	Neh, Gronk looked broken the last time we saw him. He needed a break.
fo4bygd	1587501705	Jets	team	Top 10 defensive player.Overall player? Nah. Top 25 tho
fo4byhc	1587501705	Eagles	nfl	Youll take a 4th and like it
fo4byn1	1587501708	Patriots	team	So Bill has driven away the GOAT at two positions within months. Nice.
fo4bypn	1587501709	Patriots	team	their secondary is pretty bad
fo4byt4	1587501710	Panthers	nfl	With the WWE announcers WATCH OUT WATCH OUT
fo4byu8	1587501710	Dolphins	nfl	Damn, this isnt the same Gronk, but its still going to be interesting to see how he fits
fo4byvf	1587501711	Cowboys	team	I like Romo (no homo) because hes a good guy. When you know a bit more about him, your opinion grows on how a good sportsman he is.
fo4byyo	1587501712	Ravens	team	Id be fine with a throwback jersey game where we wear this jersey but I love our current uniforms
fo4byz7	1587501712	Chiefs	team	I can picture it now...Come on guys the plane is right over here. Follow me, were going to Miami.
fo4bz6i	1587501715	Packers	nfl	Makes perfect sense for Gronk. Gets to go to a much more chill team in a state that has no income tax and is known for partying. What else could he ask for?
fo4bz8v	1587501716	Buccaneers	nfl	Brady can probably still make a throw in 2.325385 seconds which limits anything the defense can do.
fo4byrc	1587501709	Bears	nfl	He was terrible in the playoff game dude
fo4byv6	1587501711	Lions	nfl	Id much rather play with Matthew Stafford than Mitch trubisky
fo4byxy	1587501712	Ravens	team	Cant afford him or Howard.
fo4bz1d	1587501713	Patriots	nfl	Gronk is the best TE to ever touch a football.
fo4bz82	1587501716	Patriots	team	First thought exactly
fo4bz96	1587501716	Vikings	nfl	And it wasnt that he was wrong, he was just being an idiot.
fo4bzfo	1587501718	Giants	nfl	HA bruh I was like are random people sending him 40 videos and why is he timing them? Shit Ill send one too.
fo4bzp1	1587501722	Falcons	nfl	At least this will all go away in a couple years
fo4bzpa	1587501722	Patriots	team	Im curious too why would he have still been on our cap?
fo4bz46	1587501714	Buccaneers	team	I think Im in heaven
fo4bz60	1587501715	Buccaneers	team	Ladies and gentlemen... We got him!
fo4bz6h	1587501715	Cardinals	nfl	But I believe the new Eli, Daniel Jones, will save the world.
fo4bz8f	1587501716	Patriots	nfl	Like no nfl season because of the coronavirus?
fo4bzhc	1587501719	Bears	team	The patriots should draft him
fo4bzki	1587501720	Panthers	nfl	Loving NE until the day he retires doesnt mean he wouldnt have more fun playing with Tom in Tampa. Nothing youve said really addresses any points Ive made.
fo4bzlh	1587501721	Eagles	nfl	God damn the Bucs really becoming a contender.
fo4bzo9	1587501722	Patriots	nfl	Right, but if Tampa Bay said the maximum theyll offer is an exchange of 7ths New England could easily just hold onto Gronks rights. Tampa wants Gronk, they needed to make an offer that New England sees as worth it. Compare it to the deal Seattle got for Marshawn Lynch in a similar circumstance where a player wanted to return to only one team, and its a pretty good deal.
fo4bzqh	1587501723	Falcons	team	ralphwiggum.meme
fo4bzv4	1587501725	Bills	team	The sadness in the Pats sub is hilarious though.
fo4bzx3	1587501725	Rams	nfl	pls credit Leroy the dog
fo4bzxy	1587501725	Patriots	team	Hell be out for the season by week 7 so a 4th rounder isnt bad
fo4bzyy	1587501726	49ers	nfl	OJ howard for BreidaGoodwin calling it now
fo4c008	1587501726	Patriots	team	OJ Howard would instantly be our TE1 by a large margin regardless how overrated some may think he is. If we got a TE as good as Howard in the fourth Id be extremely surprised
fo4c00d	1587501726	Eagles	nfl	He uh... probably already has done that
fo4bzee	1587501718	Patriots	team	Eh I respect it. Its nothing new, hes literally been saying it for years.
fo4bzk9	1587501720	Jets	team	Q will be just fine. Everyone flips out if players dont immediately preform like a pro bowler. Hes a 22 year old kid.
fo4bzl8	1587501721	Bears	nfl	Have fun finishing in 2nd
fo4bzn9	1587501721	Steelers	nfl	It just will be nice to see NEs fan base cut to 15th.
fo4bznb	1587501722	Buccaneers	team	aaaaand we just got Gronk LMAO
fo4bzo5	1587501722	Chiefs	nfl	That TE room is disgustingly good
fo4bzpo	1587501723	Rams	team	They stole the logo though.
fo4bzpt	1587501723	Colts	team	Yes, you areYou dont plan to trade Hooker because you dont have to with his contract and talent, but what if the Dolphins offer the 5th overall? Thats why you still listen to offers
fo4bzu0	1587501724	Dolphins	nfl	I see that youve also been to Tampa.
fo4c04a	1587501728	Vikings	team	Looks like Im in the minority that doesnt want to trade 33. But Im also a real shitty armchair GM, so theres that.
fo4bztj	1587501724	Saints	nfl	AHHHHHHHHHH
fo4c05e	1587501729	Cowboys	team	We only have two receivers currently, we need 6 guys to make sure we have bodies through the season. If we trade for anything offensively, we target wrs
fo4c0dh	1587501732	Vikings	nfl	That was a super fast response there Ran
fo4c0gw	1587501733	Raiders	team	Buccaneers v. Raiders in Las Vegas has Sunday Night Football written all over it.
fo4c03g	1587501728	Buccaneers	team	With Evans and Godwin as the outside receiving threats!
fo4c077	1587501729	Buccaneers	nfl	The best part was Ive been a patriots fan but had to change to bucs flair two seasons ago so i could go undercover and now I need to find a new flair.Always been a brady fan.. belichick just made it more fun to root for the guy.LETS GO BUCS.
fo4c092	1587501730	Saints	nfl	Hey the panthers still suck!
fo4c0eq	1587501732	Patriots	nfl	ill survive
fo4c0fi	1587501732	Patriots	team	why dont we replace our clearly incompetent GM with the rpats hivemind? clearly they know something he doesnt.
fo4c0hb	1587501733	Ravens	team	The madden curse is living like a genie in AB until further notice. Sucks for him, but it was the price to pay.
fo4c0p3	1587501736	Patriots	team	We had zero leverage. Hes playing with Brady or not playing. Bucs know that. It was probably a 4th or nothing
fo4bzzv	1587501726	Packers	team	I still think he stays. The return they would want and what everyone is willing to give are two different things. Unless someone gets wowed by an offer, most players arent traded on rookie deals unless they were going to get released anyway. Rookie deals are very priced very low and OJ Howard is being paid as the 36 TE and he is still giving them a better performance than that salary indicates.
fo4c02n	1587501727	Saints	nfl	We need to cook
fo4c046	1587501728	Saints	team	Rudolph had 4 catches for 31 yards
fo4c04y	1587501728	Dolphins	nfl	Buccs got robbed
fo4c05f	1587501729	Browns	nfl	I aint gonna lie, I thought for sure NE would at least get Howard.This is crazy talk. Im shocked they got a fourth round pick. Gronk is a broken shell of a player who hasnt played football in a year.
fo4c062	1587501729	Buccaneers	team	Did he force a trade? The tweet in question just says he would like to and I havent seen anything else in the last hour to change that
fo4c066	1587501729	Broncos	nfl	Our worst head to head record is against Miami (6121 including playoffs), but weve now lost 9 straight to the Chiefs. It sucks too because we were only down in the series one game after our win in 2015 (5655), now its 6555...
fo4c06c	1587501729	Jets	nfl	At this point, Jerry Jones needs to stop being stubborn and just sign him long term.
fo4c070	1587501729	Colts	nfl	Howard to the Jags for Fournette?
fo4c0c9	1587501731	Chiefs	nfl	If youre gonna keep selling the Checkdown Kings jerseys, you cant have him finishing dead last in the division.
fo4c0i3	1587501733	Chiefs	nfl	Like Eli Manning did with the Chargers? This isnt new.
fo4c0m0	1587501735	Patriots	nfl	Honestly Id rather have this quick break up rather than 2 to 3 years of semi contending bubble team that happens to most veteran filled teams.
fo4c0sp	1587501737	Packers	nfl	Gronk pulling the good old Ozymamdias play from Watchmen.
fo4c0w7	1587501738	Patriots	nfl	Pray for COVID19 to not be an issue in September.
fo4c0x3	1587501739	Jaguars	team	I would too lol. Just greedy
fo4c0bs	1587501731	Bears	nfl	How was he in the playoffs
fo4c0mv	1587501735	49ers	nfl	That honor goes to the Jags old two tone helmet
fo4c0nq	1587501735	Chiefs	team	lmao
fo4c0tt	1587501738	Patriots	nfl	Packers would be sweet
fo4c0zl	1587501739	Patriots	nfl	Picked him up during the last week of the season just in case 
fo4c14v	1587501741	Giants	nfl	 Anyone ever think that whats happened to Brown might have been the reality check he needed.IDK hes continued to have legal issues as recetly as a 23 months ago.  Which include alledged DV, and assualt associated with that delivery company that wouldnt give him his stuff until he paid.  I dont think he has learned much.  Humans in general have an uncanny ability to shirk blame, and AB has either narcissism or some football related mental issue to boot.  I doubt he has some sort of epiphany in the last couple months.
fo4c155	1587501741	Chargers	nfl	Hes going to last 610 weeks before another injury. I think its a fair trade
fo4c1a3	1587501743	Patriots	team	all pointless, doubt they even play the season, and even if they do, he will be a shell and wont even play in more than 8 or so games.
fo4c1bc	1587501744	Vikings	team	I mock you guys trading up for Love for 34  44 (1060) in exchange for 22 (Love)  a late third, 105  155. (892.2)I think realistically you guys only have a potential trade partner in Philly before us and if Jefferson, or the big 3 receivers are still available, I cant imagine they trade out given how huge of a need WR is for them. Otherwise comes the gauntlet of NE, NOLA, GB, etc who may be willing to take a shot on Love and let him sit. AKA a trade is going to have to be pretty overwhelmingly in favor of the Vikes (or Eagles).3444 and a future second may be an option too, but definitely at least 2 seconds or conceding. Otherwise fair market point trading youd be looking at 34 or 44  75  122 (825725) and picking just once until pick 160. Rick would love that trade even if the points were lower, but Im not sure how much your roster can sustain a draft being a project QB, a second round pick and a couple picks late into the 3rd day.
fo4c0mq	1587501735	Broncos	team	Agreed. Him giving us 9 seasons of excellent football is more important to me than him trying to get that last payday.
fo4c0ni	1587501735	49ers	team	Thats gonna be fun to watch on.. Madden. Lets see Tampa play a few games before theyre anointed.
fo4c0sb	1587501737	Saints	team	Underhill posted that jenkins on 19 targets gave up 12 for 130 yards by TEs thats also in a much shittier secondary with the eagles I imagine. Ill be interesting to see who covers gronk for sure
fo4c0tv	1587501738	49ers	nfl	Way I see it is Burrow, Tua, Herbert(?), Simmons, Okudah, and Young are certainly gonna be taken before us. That means at least one of the top 4 tackles, top 2 wide receivers, and Brown will still be on the board at 13.
fo4c0yi	1587501739	Patriots	nfl	But  but Gronk is signed to WWE
fo4c115	1587501740	Patriots	team	Exactly. Do the other folks in here acting like the pats were shafted think Gronk was going to unretire to play with Hoyer or Stidham lol? Turning a 4th rounder for a 7th round and the rights to a retired player (who does not want to come back to this team) is pretty impressive in my book.
fo4c153	1587501741	Steelers	nfl	Credit Leroy you cowards
fo4c15i	1587501742	Ravens	nfl	Those were the days before big John. Different management. Tomlin has let his QB get away with rape.
fo4c15n	1587501742	Eagles	nfl	Gronks talent is totally irrelevant to my comment.
fo4c15v	1587501742	Saints	team	I meant to say moments
fo4c16u	1587501742	Giants	team	This account predicted the Jones pick last year. httpstwitter.comnflunnamedstatus1119665428505088000?s20
fo4c18d	1587501743	Giants	nfl	Whys that?
fo4c19r	1587501743	Buccaneers	team	The defense was the lone bright spot of our team last year.
fo4c1bg	1587501744	Giants	team	How is this breaking lol. Its complete conjecture
fo4c1c9	1587501744	Redskins	nfl	Were gonna see how well The Patriot Way flies with Jarrett Stidham at QB.For the past decade its been yeah we are hardass no nonsense no fun..... All the way to the 1 seed every year. That same approach will wear thin if theyre not winning.
fo4c1e2	1587501745	Bears	nfl	while true, stafford doesnt stay healthy
fo4c1fh	1587501745	Chiefs	nfl	Now I would not be surprised if TB goes running back in the first...
fo4c1h3	1587501746	Cowboys	nfl	Getting paid millions of dollars to catch a football in Tampa doesnt sound bad either.
fo4c1hc	1587501746	Lions	nfl	Bucs are gonna be a fun team to watch. I kinda always expected him to cone back.
fo4c1i1	1587501746	Eagles	nfl	I refused to watch the ending. Ive given up finishing the books at this point but I refuse to watch the ending. I watched up until like the 3rd to last episode.  I just could no longer handle how horrible the writing was.
fo4c1jw	1587501747	Giants	nfl	921 123yds 0TDs 2INTs 22.6 rating. Thank god you guys had that defense in XL because Ben was DOG SHIT.
fo4c0xd	1587501739	Colts	nfl	gets arrested for camping on private property
fo4c0zq	1587501739	Jets	nfl	Damn imagine staying in there for like 10 plus hours a day thats gotta suck.
fo4c16p	1587501742	Giants	nfl	Tom, Ive told you.  For the last time, Im retiredBrady takes his hands off Gronks eyes, revealing the big pirate ship in the stadium
fo4c19n	1587501743	Ravens	team	Copyright issue. They held a contest to design the logo.The courts determined that the Flying B was too close to a design that was submitted (it was basically an exact copy). So the Ravens lost in court and no longer have the rights to that logo.
fo4c1j7	1587501747	Eagles	team	Howie trades, not Doug.
fo4c1aa	1587501743	Eagles	nfl	Does anybody watch Set The Edge? And do they recommend it?
fo4c1hf	1587501746	Dolphins	nfl	Except they had like the 5th best oline according to pff
fo4c1iz	1587501747	Raiders	nfl	They still retain his rights.  Remember when Marshawn Lynch was with Seattle and retired?  Then he played for the Raiders the next year?  Raiders had to trade for him
fo4c1nb	1587501748	Bears	team	Oh yeah, totally different eras. He still only passed for 184 ydsgame with 15 TDs vs 11 INTs which wasnt great even for the time
fo4c1qj	1587501749	Cardinals	team	He has a tarantula on his head.
fo4c1rz	1587501750	Broncos	nfl	can happen to anyone but they DID keep happening to him. Tua sort of makes me think of Tulo in MLB when he played for my Rockies. Dude was inhuman on defense and also great with a bat, but he kept getting weird injuries and so couldnt stay on the field.I hope Im wrong but it feels like Tuas going to have a similar trajectory.
fo4c1xy	1587501752	Ravens	nfl	Eh, AB will have a very short leash with whatever team he signs with. The Pats cuts ties with him pretty easily after getting a couple good games out of him
fo4c1d7	1587501744	Dolphins	team	Wendys is pretty good, spicy chicken is amazing every time.
fo4c1it	1587501746	Patriots	team	Says who? Who says Howard was on the table at all?
fo4c1kg	1587501747	Patriots	nfl	Definitely, Bradys cant be getting sacked like he was on the Pats last year
fo4c1kq	1587501747	Panthers	team	So I probably should have specified upper secondround talent. I could see him going late in the first. I could see him falling to the middle of the second. It really depends on what team needs what. However, he may be available when we pick near the beginning of the second round, so I included him in that section.Also, many pundits have him with a 1st2nd round grade, indicating that grey area between rounds. Ive seen several mocks where we get him in the second.
fo4c1mz	1587501748	Patriots	team	For some reason this makes me want to root against the Bucs even more but I dont really know why.
fo4c1n4	1587501748	Patriots	team	I agree, but weve been missing a Blount type player. Dillon is Blount, then some. We could trade someone. Unlikely I know. Just cant believe hes projected as a 3rd or 4th rounder.
fo4c1se	1587501750	Patriots	nfl	He came to win titles and work out in the parks.And the parks, well...
fo4c1sy	1587501750	Patriots	team	You have to be kidding. Tampa are super bowl contenders. Were contenders for a top 10 pick
fo4c1tf	1587501750	Ravens	team	OJ would be nice. But he has the same years as Marlon. Cant pay Stanley, Marlon and OJ. So highest I would give up is like our 3round comp pick
fo4c1vk	1587501751	Cowboys	nfl	All Pro tight ends just dont stay retired anymore huh?   Whens Tony Gonzalez announcing his unretirement
fo4c1xf	1587501752	Patriots	team	If you think you were getting Brate or OJ for a 30 year old, 1 year removed, broken down TE, with a laundry list injury history, on a 1 year deal at a 10 million cap hit, then I got a bridge to sell ya
fo4c21u	1587501754	Patriots	team	Hey, maybe there wont be a season lol
fo4c27n	1587501756	Falcons	nfl	He will be 43 when week 1 starts. I just dont see it being super successful
fo4c1o6	1587501748	Bengals	team	Im like 7525  on NoIt IS Mike Brown.
fo4c1xq	1587501752	49ers	team	Them boys in the 5th round are hungry.
fo4c221	1587501754	Saints	nfl	I want teddy to do Well though but not too well. They still have CMC
fo4c2ce	1587501757	Browns	team	If mock drafters knew what they were talking about they would be working for nfl teams. You should never take anything any mock drafters say seriously.
fo4c22x	1587501754	Patriots	team	Then gronk applies for reinstatement and fucks the cap of BB for fucking his trade to bucs.......great plan
fo4c24y	1587501755	Lions	nfl	Im thinking that Tom Brady will be able to make faster and better decisions with the football than Jameis did. I think they got a couple guys who can get open. That will help the line.
fo4c287	1587501756	Patriots	team	I was preparing myself to be ok with a sub standard season. Now i am pissed and want revenge. Hope Belichick can pull a rabbit out the hat this year.
fo4c2mf	1587501761	Packers	nfl	Hes currently off the books except for guarantees so by coming back they have to pay his cap hit, which forces them over the cap.They either need to cut someone or trade him away and get what value they can out of him.
fo4c2se	1587501763	Ravens	nfl	He did it. The mad lad did it.
fo4c216	1587501753	Falcons	nfl	Im pissed, royally pissed
fo4c28f	1587501756	Patriots	team	You looked at his post history but didnt even manage to look at the fact that he stated he makes 58k a year. Wtf
fo4c2fh	1587501759	Buccaneers	nfl	arrrrrrrrgh
fo4c2l7	1587501761	Cowboys	team	I would not be surprised if they draft a receiver at 17
fo4c2tk	1587501764	Seahawks	nfl	Its so weird when this happens and it doesnt benefit the Patriots
fo4c2uz	1587501764	Jets	team	Cant believe he would say such things about a cancer like Jamal.
fo4c2xb	1587501765	Patriots	nfl	Lets say New England goes 88 this year.  Would I rather see Brady and Gronk, two key pieces of their recent SB runs, win one more together or fail miserably?  Uh, win one  theyve earned it.Lets say New England goes 313 this year instead.  Id still rather see Brady and Gronk succeed.Literally the only way this would impact me negatively is if Gronk catches the game winning touchdown against McCourty in the Super Bowl, and then Ill be pretty happy because in our first year with an unproven quarterback, they made the damn Super Bowl.
fo4c2ar	1587501757	Patriots	team	Yall got a 4th rounder lmao. Lucky yall got that for a retired TE.
fo4c2cl	1587501758	Colts	team	Quality Content
fo4c2eg	1587501758	Buccaneers	team	i thought this was a fucking joke. we got the goat out of retirement , ive never been happier
fo4c2gm	1587501759	Cowboys	nfl	I could do without it tbh.
fo4c2n1	1587501761	Patriots	team	Not as curious as joe motherI am a bot. Downvote to remove. PM(httpswww.reddit.commessagecompose?toYoMommaJokeBot) me if theres anything for me to know!
fo4c2ra	1587501763	Cowboys	nfl	Lol if you think that Darren McFadden in 2015 with Brandon WeedenMatt Cassel is on par with Zeke in 2016, Ill call you an idiot right now.That 2016 was all Zeke and the offensive line. Any qb that could throw a 7 yard pass would have done well in that scenario.The point is that they might not have gone 133. But they would have won 10 games no matter who was qb. And having a better qb in the playoffs is all that mattered considering they went one and done largely to Dak being unable to move the ball against the 30th ranked secondary for an entire half.Do you want a regular season record, or do you want playoff success? Not starting Romo was a mistake and we have the actual results to show it. They lost in the DV. We know it was a mistake.
fo4c2r9	1587501763	Patriots	team	WHEW lol. Tbf it was all caught up in the hype and DJ was probably just dreamin up a hype tweet for the fun
fo4c2rt	1587501763	Chargers	nfl	If they get Cj Henderson Im done
fo4c2s0	1587501763	Steelers	nfl	What? Ali Marpet and Ryan Jensen are both very good, and Donovan Smith is average. They are shaky after that, but this is a strong oline draft. Thats far from a piece of loose leaf paper and better than what Brady dealt with last year
fo4c2t9	1587501764	Patriots	nfl	Even Thuney for OJ  2nd Rounder is questionable... hes one of the best OL in the league. Gronk barely plays into the formula on that one.
fo4c33l	1587501768	Buccaneers	team	Holy fucking shit. This is the craziest timeline.
fo4c2to	1587501764	Falcons	team	Two washed up players in a real NFL division?
fo4c2x7	1587501765	Patriots	team	He won 98 of his passblock matchups. I dont need him to be elite I just want a clean pocket back.
fo4c30g	1587501767	Browns	nfl	Depends, we talking dangerous on the football field or off the field?
fo4c37m	1587501769	Giants	team	I watched him all of college he can be the best lb weve had since him
fo4c2rs	1587501763	49ers	nfl	Lmao very fair.
fo4c33n	1587501768	Jets	team	I feel like no one is really talking about this quote. JD said hes going to take the best player available which is the same thing his mentor Ozzie Newsome did. I dont believe he likes all 4 OT. I think he likes maybe 2 or 3 and if all 3 are gone which is a strong possibility, I can see him drafting the best player available which would most like be a WR. Teams that could draft OT before we do Giants  Their GM has already said they plan on protecting D. Jones. Gettleman doesnt smokescreen and drafts what he says he will draft if you look at his history the past two years. Cardinals  They want to protect their young QB and they already have a top WRJags  Theyre a wild card. Not really sure what they plan on doing. They seem to be tanking for next year so they might just address OL. Browns  Theyve made it clear that they want to protect Baker. In this scenario, I could see us trading back or drafting a WR. Ive been on record saying that I like Jeudy more but Ive been watching tape on both him and CeeDee Lamb and Lamb has much better hands. Lamb catches the ball with ease while Jeudy is more of a body catcher. On the other hand, Jeudy is a better route runner. Im so glad Im not a GM because I dont know what Id do in this scenario.
fo4c3ac	1587501770	Seahawks	nfl	GOAT DOING GOAT THING! Somebody retire Brady pleaaaaase
fo4c3au	1587501771	Patriots	team	Brady has literally never had a losing season. You think the Bucs wont have a winning team?
fo4c3cr	1587501771	Jaguars	nfl	I dont think I could handle it when his back gets snapped on the first play of the season.
fo4c3dg	1587501772	Dolphins	nfl	Guys, I think downtown Tampa is gonna be wild after some home wins. Cant wait to see Gronk out in SoHo or Ybor
fo4c3k7	1587501774	Jaguars	team	Yes
fo4c3ko	1587501774	Raiders	nfl	They retain his rights
fo4c3mp	1587501775	Colts	nfl	Its a win win, hardly a fleece. Pats literally get a free 4th rounder and the bucs get Gronk for a pick that hardly ever makes the final 53.
fo4c2y0	1587501766	Buccaneers	nfl	Bingo. He wont play for anyone other than TB12, so basically the Pats are getting a free upgrade while Gronk still holds a little value that theyd never get out of him anyway. Win win for sure.
fo4c347	1587501768	Patriots	team	Something to do with still being under contract? Im really not sure though
fo4c36e	1587501769	Buccaneers	team	WOW
fo4c3dh	1587501772	Patriots	team	You dont understand player value if you think a guy retired for year with massive amounts of wear and tear, that showed significant decline, is suddenly worth a second round pick in the NFL. He could end up playing to that level, or he could be a total shell of himself, no one is giving up a premium pick to find out.
fo4c3e5	1587501772	Eagles	nfl	H2P
fo4c3gq	1587501773	Patriots	team	Yeah maybe Im functioning on emotion right now but I am pissed
fo4c3gu	1587501773	Patriots	team	Tampa Bay patriots
fo4c3j2	1587501774	Browns	team	Good
fo4c3y3	1587501779	Broncos	nfl	I sent my time in as well, even though my guys can confirm I ran a 4.32 on tape, NFL scouts are lying and claim I ran a 9.56.
fo4c41i	1587501781	Patriots	team	Pats dont have a choice. If Gronk comes back and hes not traded we get a 10 mill cap hit and we are already cash strapped. This is like bargaining with a gun held to your head. I was honestly expecting a 5th.
fo4c3l5	1587501775	Cardinals	team	tbf he said if he came back hed want to play for Kliff here with us... not in Tampa for Bruce.
fo4c3rk	1587501777	Seahawks	nfl	At first, I thought it was Kam who somehow had leveled him, because Earl normally wasnt the hard hitter of the group.  But he had a textbook shoulder lead on that replay.
fo4c3rn	1587501777	Patriots	team	Depends on what youre talkinga bout.  If I want a guy pancaked or want to run a dumpoff in space Ill take Kittle.   If I want a guy to snatch a laser out of the sky over the middle for 15 yards, Ill take Kelce.
fo4c3tx	1587501778	Cardinals	nfl	The channels you listed arent really analytics channel, theyre tape breakdown guys. I dont think thats what OP is asking for necessarilyThe answer is, NFL advanced analytics isnt really on YouTube. Its on Twitter.
fo4c3zf	1587501780	Patriots	nfl	see thats just a smokescreen
fo4c45x	1587501782	Patriots	team	Good news You can visit scenic Tampa AND see the Patriots in the next Superbowl at the same time.
fo4c49e	1587501783	Patriots	team	Do you guys hate BradyGronk now?
fo4c49w	1587501784	Chiefs	nfl	Where do I learn about how the contract works for retired players making a comeback?Or can someone explain it to me?
fo4c3pl	1587501776	Patriots	nfl	Yeah some people really think that our fan base would look at this maliciously. Of course we view them as our guys and lifelong Patriots. They played for the Pats their whole careers up until now and are easy HoF players that are or contend for the GOAT title in their positions. How could we turn our back on that? Sure some people have knee jerk reactions but that definitely isnt the general consensus.It pains me to know Ill have to watch them in another jersey and it will be an incredibly surreal experience, but you bet your ass I will watch every Bucs game next season and will be rooting for their success in every way that doesnt negatively affect the Pats.
fo4c3zr	1587501780	Raiders	nfl	Many, according to a quick look at Google Maps. A few are in Ybor. Now I want to see Drunk Pirate Gronk at the Knight Parade hoisting a fucking chicken.
fo4c3zt	1587501780	Buccaneers	nfl	Hes still 247 champ though
fo4c42u	1587501781	Saints	team	Kittle also barely did anything until that one catch
fo4c45f	1587501782	Patriots	team	Gronk gets something and the Pats get something so its hard to complain.  Gronk can ball out like nobodies business but in the last few years, hes had a problem with injuries.  A young QB would just put him in riskier situations.  I would have liked to see a little more compensation, but its hard to argue that it isnt a net positive for the Pats.
fo4c471	1587501782	Titans	team	OL jerseys are the best jerseys man
fo4c47t	1587501783	Raiders	team	I cant imagine to live with the amount of pain that you have in your anus
fo4c4al	1587501784	Patriots	team	Their defense is very good as well. top 10 run defense with good pass rushers.
fo4c4av	1587501784	Vikings	team	I have the US Bank stadium set and want to build it so bad  it I dont have anywhere to put it. Also have a 5 year old and 2 year old that would want to play with it. Someday Ill get around to it.
fo4c4bl	1587501784	Raiders	nfl	It is my great honor to inform you that we all find pleasure in your emotional turmoil. And Id like to remind you, in case you somehow forgot, that you deserve this.
fo4c4fn	1587501786	Patriots	nfl	Bold of you to assume a random redditor can go sub 6 seconds
fo4c4du	1587501785	Lions	nfl	Dan Snyder is easily the worst. Total fucking scumbag
fo4c4go	1587501786	Vikings	team	The OP said it was impossible... but invited people to play what if anyway.  Whats so hard for you to understand about that?
fo4c4l0	1587501788	Patriots	team	Right there with you brother, Brady was the team.
fo4c4my	1587501788	Patriots	nfl	Its not impossible just unlikely. Boyle, Hurst, and Andrews are not Gronk, Brate, and Howard. Beyond that, there have been serious rumblings that Howard has been available as a piece on the move for weeks now, and a frayed relationship in TB. This just makes it all the more likelyNow I do think that if they DID end up keeping all 3, youre right in assuming it would be to try to limit snap counts.
fo4c4nf	1587501789	Bears	team	Not just a Pace hater, but a Bears one. The guy just enjoys being negative and miserable.
fo4c4pl	1587501790	Browns	nfl	I really think there is no way we get clowney... but there is no universe in which your offense needs more firepower
fo4c4ua	1587501791	Chargers	team	This post was a lie
fo4c46c	1587501782	Buccaneers	team	agree
fo4c48o	1587501783	Vikings	team	No RB is worth 14. TB would never make this trade. No single team in the league would ever take this. If a team was elite and deep at every single position, and truly had no holes except at RB, they would just draft Swift at 14. He is younger and cheaper.
fo4c49b	1587501783	Patriots	team	WHERES JULES SOMEONE FIND JULES AND LOCK HIM IN THE BUILDING
fo4c4ae	1587501784	Giants	nfl	won dumbintelligent!Lol
fo4c4qe	1587501790	Colts	nfl	Holy shit in 4 years he went 61 games with 56 touchdowns. What happened? Injury or just a newer somehow better rb?
fo4c4ud	1587501791	Packers	nfl	ITS OVER WERE WINNING IT ALL
fo4c4yl	1587501793	Eagles	nfl	Im not even sure how they got THIS. The move from a 7th to a 4th for essentially nothing, its nuts.
fo4c4dx	1587501785	Bills	nfl	Speedhawk is that you?
fo4c4gw	1587501786	Seahawks	nfl	Given how things have gone for Saban since he made that choice.. it might be the best mistake of his career.
fo4c4mt	1587501788	Dolphins	nfl	Except he didnt... he just fumbled the ball away
fo4c4n6	1587501789	Lions	nfl	Not seeing a 30yearold white midget receiver on this roster. Brady will be totally impotent.
fo4c4on	1587501789	Saints	nfl	Yeah Brady coming off the worst year of his career being carried to the playoffs by his incredible defense is definitely scary. Especially now that he has the Buccs defense to rely on lmaoDude is going to be murdered by that Oline. I almost feel bad that your fans are getting hope. At least Gronk is super entertaining on and off the field.
fo4c4qz	1587501790	Patriots	team	Not happy but a 4th to help trade up for a TE that wasnt gonna play for us again. Not mad
fo4c59r	1587501797	Jaguars	nfl	Florida Patriots fans dying their jerseys red and pewter as we speak.
fo4c5af	1587501797	Seahawks	nfl	Hes skinny as fuck.
fo4c4y0	1587501793	Patriots	team	He had already switched to Bradys pliability focused training instead of classic strength training.
fo4c51g	1587501794	Raiders	team	Yep...brain fart with hooker being mentioned in the thread
fo4c57k	1587501796	Seahawks	nfl	Editing God.Move out of the way speedhawk
fo4c58t	1587501797	Cardinals	nfl	No shit.
fo4c5ag	1587501797	Patriots	nfl	Gonna send in a sped up video of me running a 40
fo4c5cw	1587501798	Jaguars	team	Oh no I absolutely agree with you and think a first rounder is a waste. My mocks have been Beefy boys, CB then WR (Bryan Edwards)But if JK fell to the midlate second SOMEHOW then Id be for trading up and snagging him, assuming LF is off the roster.
fo4c5j6	1587501801	49ers	nfl	This is what happens when IT bans me from reddit. Gronk becomes a Buc.
fo4c5pq	1587501803	Browns	nfl	Very first huddle of the season R Truth comes running out on the field and rolls him
fo4c5co	1587501798	Patriots	team	The uh..Bucs didnt want to trade howard for a fucking second back before the deadline?x200BHow much wiggle room and worth do you think we had in this trade?
fo4c5gc	1587501800	Vikings	nfl	Hungry. But Im in the process of fixing that.
fo4c5hk	1587501800	Patriots	team	I swear the bucs have already passed Miami, Lions, and the titans in being Patriots copy cats.
fo4c5hm	1587501800	Broncos	team	just my opinion? it looks exactly like the browns to me minus a slight difference in orange...
fo4c5j5	1587501801	Patriots	nfl	People were saying everything from a first to us swapping 7th round picks lol
fo4c5ld	1587501801	Seahawks	nfl	There was a tweet a few days ago from an NFL scout that said, paraphrasing here I was a scout in the NFL for 20 years and I could count on my hands the number of guys I timed at 4.3 I know its an agents job to get them drafted as high as they can but this has gotta be a little concerning right?
fo4c5ub	1587501805	Patriots	team	Theyre about to be the new Detroit
fo4c5yt	1587501807	Jaguars	nfl	Fine by me
fo4c5ev	1587501799	Buccaneers	team	Tampa Bay Buccaneers LEGENDS Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski
fo4c5rl	1587501804	Patriots	team	When I see Gronk take a snap in a game wearing a Tampa Bay uniform Ill stop then. P
fo4c608	1587501808	Panthers	nfl	Tepper is the worst. He interferes in team operations like Jerry Jones and puts words in players mouths. Greg OlsenI want to play in CarolinaTepperWe mutually decided to part waysCam NewtonI want to play in CarolinaTepperCam has sought a trade
fo4c60t	1587501808	Cowboys	nfl	actually in the video where he evades the redskins player i think he literally broke a vertebrae on that play. was 2013 i believe
fo4c5q4	1587501803	Vikings	team	Everyone liked that
fo4c5q6	1587501803	Ravens	team	I havent bought a Madden game since like 06? This will be the first I buy in like 15 years, HELL YA.
fo4c5qg	1587501804	Lions	team	Not OP but this years draft looks to be much better with high end talent, and we are 5 picks ahead of where we were.
fo4c5x1	1587501806	Bengals	nfl	Its either him, Mike Brown, or the Rams owner.
fo4c5xb	1587501806	Patriots	team	I wonder what the Bucs offered that BB turned down....cause you know they did.
fo4c5xk	1587501806	Patriots	nfl	You kidding? Im absolutely pumped for Brady! Im a pats fan at heart but I wanna see Brady go off even if its on another team. Also Gronk was only gonna come out of retirement if he went to the Bucs, hes worth nothing to us retired, so we basically just got a 4th rounder for a 7th, thats a good deal for us!
fo4c66f	1587501810	49ers	team	Jeremy Chinn (Safety) Southern IllinoisNephew of Steve Atwater. Measurables linked below. httpsimgur.comgallery2FiKo7N
fo4c6c1	1587501812	Patriots	nfl	While I think that is truth, health and Longevity also play a roll and what makes Brady the best of all time. Guys like Tony Gonzales, Antonio Gates were great Athletes but also lasted forever.
fo4c6fi	1587501813	Browns	nfl	hahahaha what? No, at worst his body dissolves in training camp and he never makes it on the field for a regular season snap.
fo4c6it	1587501815	Panthers	team	We are definitely finishing last in the division, no doubt. We are the least competitive team in the South right now.
fo4c6j9	1587501815	Buccaneers	team	Jumping into this Pats circle jerk, waiting for the news that Edelman is heading south as well.
fo4c5vm	1587501806	Bills	nfl	Even Gronk hates the Pats.  You love to see it.
fo4c5wm	1587501806	Patriots	nfl	Draft Clyde EdwardsHelaire in the 2nd alongside the top OT or DT in the first and the bucs are set
fo4c5y2	1587501807	Raiders	nfl	Lets Go!!!
fo4c5zl	1587501807	Patriots	nfl	On this day 0 years ago they traded for Rob Gronkowski.
fo4c5zp	1587501807	Jets	nfl	Its okay, Jets fans. They cant hurt us anymore.
fo4c60r	1587501808	Patriots	team	The culture will be so much different than the pats undisciplined players and freelancers.
fo4c60u	1587501808	Falcons	team	Uh...No.If Brady throwing to Evans and Godwin and Brees throwing to Thomas and Kamara wasnt enough to convince us that we need a starting CB and perhaps a coverage LB hybrid, what will?Give me Okudah or Simmons or Henderson.
fo4c641	1587501809	49ers	team	Engrams the better pass catcher (247 targets  153 rec) than Howard (140 targets and 94 rec)Both have 12 career TDs and similar yardage, but are coming off disappointing 3rd seasons (Engram with injuries, Howard in Arians doghouse)Both are former 1st round picks, so they each have one year left PLUS their 5thyear option on their rookie contracts (so essentially two years)It all comes down to how Arians values Howard (if at all), hes never really been a big proponent of TEs in his offenses in the past. Maybe they would take a midround pick (or RB?) to replace the 4th they just traded away?Idk why the Giants would be rushing to trade Engram either unless they just want as many picks as possible in their rebuild, they think Engram is shot physically, andor they want to build around Kaden Smith at TE?
fo4c64k	1587501809	Raiders	nfl	Lmao, Brady and now Gronk?
fo4c652	1587501809	Dolphins	nfl	Youve probably been saying that alot lately
fo4c688	1587501811	Bears	team	100, a starting CB (who can play press) is great.  The other 2nd, or trading back, I could go with a dynamic S, or an LT...Ruiz and Cushenberry are in consideration too.  But I am not taking a TE here, WR can be had later, and there are some guys late that I like at S, WR, TE, EDGE, OL, etc.  (Too many mocks, and you fall in love with guys you can get late)
fo4c6b5	1587501812	Patriots	nfl	Arm chair pyschology shouldnt be upvotedYou are just projecting Lol
fo4c6dt	1587501813	Cowboys	nfl	Im not so sure about that one. Not that Romo wouldnt have played great, but Dak did too tbh. He did everything a QB needs to do win that game. 9 times out of 10 after Daks go ahead drive we move onto the next round. Its not Daks fault Rodgers is a magician.
fo4c6kl	1587501815	Patriots	team	It was all dream
fo4c6mi	1587501816	Raiders	nfl	If he was lying, dont you think he would have went harder at BOB? I mean, he threw some shade, foe sure, but it was still pretty gentle criticism, overall.
fo4c6ae	1587501811	Falcons	nfl	Hes absolutely the GOAT tight end and I love Tony
fo4c6jx	1587501815	Buccaneers	team	Honestly idk, he might not be near the level player he used to be
fo4c6pk	1587501817	Vikings	team	Like 80 of this sub wants to trade Dalvin. Hes not worth anything close to the 14th pick and you know that.
fo4c6sm	1587501818	49ers	nfl	Go get cereal again
fo4c6u7	1587501819	Panthers	team	NFC South now has the two of the top 5 teams on the NFL.Yikessssss
fo4c6ve	1587501819	Lions	team	mute button you know a team is going to get caught chatting shit about someone .
fo4c6xr	1587501820	Bills	nfl	He was 22nd in TDS though, doesnt sound like a top 10 TE to me. The last season that he played he was not a top 10 TE and stats back it up. Sure over his career hes the best or second best (as far as talent) all time, but the only stat you can use to determine he was top 10 is yards lol
fo4c6yj	1587501820	49ers	nfl	Right, but if instead of the Bucs imagine youre in a division thats actually competitive and its a division rival. In that case having Gronk on the couch instead of the opposing sideline 23 times that year might be worth more to you than a 4th.
fo4c6gx	1587501814	Eagles	nfl	you were serious? say sike right now
fo4c6jd	1587501815	Giants	nfl	Yea are we just forgetting that Brady clearly showed significant decline last year, and that was in a system hed been familiar with his whole career.
fo4c6kb	1587501815	Falcons	team	Woth this it just seems more clear we need Simmons woth his ability to rush and cover he would be perfect aginst Gronk
fo4c6t6	1587501818	Jets	team	Incoming generational IDL to follow the legendary ways of Big Cat and Q s
fo4c6u5	1587501819	Broncos	team	I live in Boston. The ones here dont have to over identify with the teams in order to maintain their identity like Pats fans everywhere else do. They understand this is a fuck you to Belly, not the fans. They worry about Gronks health though. Its not like he had too many brain cells to start with.
fo4c6wo	1587501820	Ravens	nfl	Didnt Tom Brady keep AB as a guest in his house? QBs like having good players on their side
fo4c733	1587501822	Jets	team	nam flashbacks
fo4c6r2	1587501818	Bears	team	Ok
fo4c6tf	1587501819	Patriots	team	How is no one else excited to see Brady and gronk play again together? Like he wasnt gonna play for us either way
fo4c6uk	1587501819	Patriots	team	On paper, we made something out of nothing... Still makes me want to vomit to think of Brady throwing a TD to Gronk while wearing Bucs unis.
fo4c6v8	1587501819	Bears	nfl	Yes
fo4c715	1587501821	Buccaneers	nfl	Wouldve won state if coach put me in
fo4c73h	1587501822	Bengals	team	Im cautiously optimistic.  Guy didnt play a meaningful snap all of last year due to injury, and hes a rookie.  Hes an unknown factor.
fo4c765	1587501823	Patriots	team	Why though? Those things make the Steelers bumblebees look like something a human being could voluntarily wear.
fo4c77m	1587501824	Patriots	nfl	 I was not in a good place. Football was bringing me down, and I didnt like it. I was losing that joy in life... I could play right now if I wanted to play. Im feeling good. Physically, I could do it. Mentallywise, desirewise, its not there... I am very satisfied with where I am in life right now. I truly believe going through those tough times, nine years, off the field, on the field, has brought me to this point. I believe Im on the right path in my life.
fo4c79f	1587501824	Patriots	team	Im rooting for covid to cancel the season
fo4c7dk	1587501826	Eagles	nfl	httpswww.npr.orgsectionscoronavirusliveupdates20200421840262570barropentolegalactionifgovernorsrestrictionsgotoofar
fo4c6ut	1587501819	Steelers	nfl	Yeah all teams with QBs over 40 should just pack it in next season, theres no way a team can be successful with one of those
fo4c70k	1587501821	Falcons	team	Here you go(httpswww.tampabay.comsportsgators20200416nfldrafthowcjhendersoncomparestogatorsotherstardefensivebacks)Not only was Haden drafted ten years ago from an entirely different UF regime, the rest of the schools DB draftees have mostly failed to impress. That even includes people who played with Henderson and even outplayed him (Teez Tabor, per the article). Again, if he is Joe Haden, cool. If he is Teez Tabor and we trade multiple assets to get him in the top ten? Yikes.Dan Quinns obsession with UF needs to be tossed aside. He worked there for two seasons eight years ago and has no ties to Henderson or the current coaching staff. With the teams ahead of the Falcons potentially locked in for WRs and elite offensive line talent, see if he falls to 16. If not, oh well.
fo4c70z	1587501821	Patriots	team	Right, because only one team is involved in trade talks
fo4c742	1587501822	Saints	nfl	Had one subpar game. Im sure thats never happened to any QB
fo4c79j	1587501824	Buccaneers	team	Do you mean Lebowski? The White Russian guy?
fo4c7av	1587501825	Eagles	nfl	lmao Mahomes is the protagonist
fo4c7ce	1587501826	Bears	nfl	Hmm yes this TE who hasnt played for a year that lost a considerable amount of bulk will be worth... 3 firsts, 10 seconds, and the Glazers first born grandsons
fo4c7hu	1587501827	Rams	nfl	Is it regularly accepted?
fo4c7nq	1587501830	Falcons	team	Not sure why people are worried. I dont see Gronk playing more than 6 games this season
fo4c7rc	1587501831	Patriots	nfl	Dont forget what the Pats offence looked like at the beginning of last season though.
fo4c7ti	1587501832	Bengals	team	Nothing will hype me more than Burrow but if it were any other year, Id say Jonah would get me there too.
fo4c7gy	1587501827	Broncos	team	Man and we dont even know if Bryce is going to play. Holy shit lol
fo4c7hb	1587501827	Patriots	team	Lmao this is wild
fo4c7kz	1587501829	Patriots	team	Man I believe it!!! Takes off a year get back healthy with help of cbd
fo4c7la	1587501829	Patriots	team	Gronk never taunted a comeback. At all. People just wildly speculated and wanted him to come back.
fo4c7lg	1587501829	Rams	team	At about 022 in the video. They start talking about the curvature of the bolt and then say, nah, who cares.
fo4c7nt	1587501830	Chargers	team	Look at them.Try to figure out which one to order.Look at them.Try to figure out which one to order.Ad infinitum
fo4c7p7	1587501830	Buccaneers	team	I cant wait to see Gronk tailgating with Arians after games this year
fo4c81r	1587501835	Cowboys	nfl	Or they probably choke the game away like they did anyway. Guess it depends on your perspective. You want to talk hypotheticals, or real events? How about Pettigrew grabbing Hitchens by the facemask and pulling Hitch into the DPI? Was missing that a bad call? Or just run of the mill since you cant claim it cost the Lions the game?
fo4c7l9	1587501829	Buccaneers	nfl	So this is what heaven feels like, right?
fo4c7vi	1587501833	Patriots	nfl	Thats... Actually not bad
fo4c7xd	1587501834	Patriots	team	 these are pointless and outright stupid posts.Yet here we are. The only stupid thing here is the ego of a weird ass man trying to puff his chest out on reddit.
fo4c837	1587501836	Bengals	team	yes u are a crazy this is because geaux jeaux burreaux
fo4c7x5	1587501834	Eagles	team	 The schedule hasnt been released yet. This isnt in order.
fo4c82o	1587501835	Giants	nfl	Deion said he was the best.  Why would he lie to me?
fo4c86y	1587501837	Patriots	team	Arians is a fucking clown
fo4c89b	1587501838	Seahawks	nfl	i dont know if gamepass goes back that far but go back and watch Dolphins  Steelers from 2007. if you can survive that game, come back and well give you some better recommendations
fo4c82w	1587501836	Patriots	nfl	Reports are that Gronk was done with New England, but wasnt done with playing with Brady. Maybe his relationship with Belichick was changed after getting traded to the Lions (he had to threaten retirement for that one to fall through)?
fo4c83j	1587501836	Titans	team	Henry missed a game too
fo4c853	1587501837	Saints	nfl	Our defense couldnt stop shit that game, and our oline was the worse I have ever seen it. Only thing Brees was at fault for was the interception. I was at the game, I remember how we lost.
fo4c86n	1587501837	Eagles	nfl	Revis do be the only guy with the balls to line up man and follow Randy Moss around the field
fo4c8mf	1587501843	Cowboys	team	If Ruggs, Juedy, or Lamar that they definitely will.  Otherwise, they will likely take CB, OLB, EDGE, C before they take a WR in R1
fo4c8oo	1587501844	Patriots	nfl	Yeah I was hoping they would get OJ in the deal, but this is like a free 4th so cant really complain. Gronk would have never suited up for the Pats again, so anything is better than nothing.
fo4c8q6	1587501845	Patriots	nfl	Patriots trade 4th round pick for him
fo4c895	1587501838	Buccaneers	team	I have to believe OJs going to be dealt now, maybe as part of a deal to move up to get one of the top OLs.
fo4c8cy	1587501840	Steelers	nfl	You have to hand to Belichick he basically got a free 4th round pick for a player who was never going to play for them again.
fo4c8gy	1587501841	Steelers	nfl	Dan Snyder still exists...
fo4c8hl	1587501841	Dolphins	nfl	Saints fans right now... thought they couldnt get worse... but here we are
fo4c8mm	1587501843	Patriots	team	Seriously, Ill take a 4th for a player who was retired a day ago and who was never going to play for the pats again.
fo4c8wy	1587501847	Patriots	team	They won 7 games with Jameis throwing 30 picks and 7 of those Pick 6s. They were a 1112 win team last year if Brady was there. Now they have a better team with Gronk.Brady is going to have control and an offense tailored to him, its ridiculous to think it wouldnt be. It only proves it more with this Gronk trade. They will be using TEs way more now.You just sound really pissed that Brady left.
fo4c8i0	1587501842	Chiefs	nfl	If earl had been in man coverage and Kam coming for the hit part of me wonders if that is a pick and Gronk leaves the game...
fo4c8jg	1587501842	Packers	nfl	Hes the real answer to the question What if Yoda was six feet tall and could smoke weed(httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vSDEZNN4Ei3A)
fo4c8nv	1587501844	49ers	team	I feel like weve seen what Brady can do with two athletic pass catching TEs before.  There is definitely no reason to think theyd be getting rid of O.J. unless its just to unload his contract.
fo4c8r0	1587501845	Redskins	nfl	From that bitch Carole Baskins.
fo4c8ry	1587501845	Falcons	nfl	Id rather have Hayden Hurst at this point.
fo4c8si	1587501845	Patriots	team	How anybody stops them is beyond me. He doesnt have a hall of fame wr like moss but top to bottom its the most fire power he has had in his career.
fo4c8th	1587501846	Chiefs	nfl	Malignant Backfield Cancer
fo4c8v3	1587501846	Bills	team	I hate that cunt more than Brady and Belichick combined. I hope he take one step onto the field again and gets hurt just as badly as he hoped to hurt Tre.
fo4c8zj	1587501848	Patriots	team	lmao chill out buddy its a game
fo4c919	1587501849	Redskins	team	How many lower body injuries has Trent had? Plus a brain tumor. They were both drafted in 2010. Trent has missed 40 games and Gronk 45 (including 2019).
fo4c8p3	1587501844	Giants	team	Not sexy or mad at it  doesnt instantly make us much better...unless hes an instant allpro.  Another building for the future pick.  2020 will be rough, another year of being bombed on Sundays and deeply hungover on Monday.
fo4c8qf	1587501845	Seahawks	nfl	Im sure this is a meme... but...Buffalos pretty far from NYC. But is LaGuardia the airport you fly out of to go internationally (Europe, Africa, Latin America, etc.)? Like, if you live in Buffalo and want to visit Paris, how do you get there?
fo4c8rf	1587501845	Browns	team	I would enjoy this
fo4c8sr	1587501846	Saints	team	Brady and Arians is definitely different from Baker and Kitchens tho
fo4c8ve	1587501847	Buccaneers	team	Pretty good lol
fo4c8xm	1587501847	Chargers	nfl	Yea, you know all about that Dream Team off season. Its way too early to tell, plus, Gronk is a shell of his former self  look at what the teams gave up.
fo4c923	1587501849	Patriots	nfl	Didnt stop NE from winning 12 games last year
fo4c92b	1587501849	Chiefs	team	1ChiefsKingdom tends to do that.
fo4c94c	1587501850	Saints	nfl	Bringing someone in on a short leash they will immediately choke themselves on is a waste of time
fo4c96s	1587501851	Dolphins	team	Me too.
fo4c9ch	1587501853	Vikings	nfl	For one, Revis didnt do it very long. Not saying this is the end of the argument, but he really only had a handful of shutdown seasons.
fo4c9gq	1587501855	Patriots	team	I would imagine Tampa wanted to keep him to protect Brady with Gronk on the other side. Can Brate play WR? Either way, theyre stacked for weapons and I doubt theyd want to give up a pass blocker like Howard.
fo4c9i1	1587501856	Patriots	nfl	Corona just take me already
fo4c9mx	1587501858	Eagles	nfl	they got a 4th rounder, so, close?
fo4c9nl	1587501858	Falcons	team	Imagine if we get Simmons. Having Neal and Simmons on the field at the same time would cause sooo many fucking headaches. Whos rushing whos dropping in cover, Simmons can cover the slot. Extreme versatility.
fo4c90c	1587501849	Eagles	team	Miss Lippys car....is green.
fo4c9ax	1587501853	Panthers	nfl	Why would the Bucs past with different management, different coaches, and different players have any impact on their success next year?
fo4c9g2	1587501855	Lions	nfl	Thats so untrue. Before last season he was close to being the active player with the longest start streak without missing a game.
fo4c9jd	1587501856	Jets	team	Water is wet Jets GM Joe Douglas
fo4c9ob	1587501858	Bears	team	Half eaten bag of chips might still be too much for him
fo4c9v5	1587501861	Patriots	team	No. Gronk was retired, his cap hit did not count against the cap. The only penalty we suffered from Gronks retiring was a 2m dead cap charge that came and went in 2019
fo4c98p	1587501852	Patriots	team	Is this not for this years draft pick?
fo4c9m0	1587501857	Chiefs	team	Whered you get that chiefs helmet piece?
fo4c9p4	1587501859	Chargers	nfl	LA Angel Dodge Ramcharger lakeclippers galaxy kingducks, F.C.
fo4c9rj	1587501859	Patriots	team	And miami
fo4c9zm	1587501862	Patriots	team	Edelmans next.I guarantee it.
fo4c9kt	1587501857	Jets	nfl	The Brady man cant hurt us anymore
fo4c9vw	1587501861	Chiefs	nfl	Somebody call Eli right fucking now.
fo4c9x6	1587501862	Patriots	team	The only person making any sense around hereHail FootballSatan!
fo4c9xq	1587501862	Buccaneers	team	really excited to watch you guys this season. should be really great football.
fo4ca73	1587501865	Bills	nfl	I tried it for a bit, but would always cancel month to month just so I get the one box with stuff relevant to what Im looking for. Plus, the delay was always weird where I was never sure if this was an accident or an ontime delivery.
fo4ca7k	1587501865	Bears	nfl	No thanks
fo4c9vf	1587501861	Seahawks	nfl	And now AB too
fo4c9xt	1587501862	Patriots	team	Why would Tampa rather give up a pick to get a third TE in Gronk who might not contribute anyway on an offense that doesnt even utilize the position outside of blocking?They clearly wanted him or else they wouldnt have traded for him.
fo4ca7n	1587501865	Bears	nfl	except visit a park
fo4caax	1587501867	Bears	nfl	Damn too bad yesterday was 420
fo4c8uy	1587501846	Giants	team	Hope its wills
fo4c9sg	1587501860	Patriots	team	You cant lose against the Patriots if you become the Patriots.
fo4c9un	1587501861	Buccaneers	team	Im just imagining them announcing him before the games lol. Number 69, Rob Gronkowski!!! Then they fire the cannons!
fo4c9xh	1587501862	Patriots	team	Are you sure? I dont understand how he was still on our cap
fo4c9y5	1587501862	Patriots	team	...what? If we trade him he doesnt impact our cap
fo4c9yk	1587501862	Patriots	nfl	Yeah, GRONK said hed only play with Tom.
fo4ca14	1587501863	Patriots	team	If I want a tight end Ill take Kittle. If I want a big wide receiver Ill take Kelce.
fo4ca2k	1587501863	Patriots	nfl	The problem with 3TE sets is either Evans or Godwin would need to come off the field. Gronk, OJ and Brate are all decent TEs at this stage but none of them would be worth playing over either of those 2 other than like goalline.
fo4caa8	1587501866	Patriots	team	Seriously... getting a 4th for him was actually amazing I dont know why people are salty. If he chose to unretire wed have to cut him anyway and hed just go to the Bucs for free. We literally got a 4th for nothing.
fo4cahb	1587501870	Texans	team	Jordan Fuller, Malcom Roach, Quez Watkins
fo4ca2g	1587501863	49ers	nfl	Nah, Speedhawk was a FS
fo4ca2d	1587501863	Buccaneers	team	Ugh.  This is really testing my loyalty to the Bucs, this is sooooo cheesy.  Bucs cant do shit unless they take the Pats castoffs.  I want media about the Bucs, not some hasbeen Pats usedtabes. This is embarrassing.   Ill still cheer for them, but if I were a fan of any other team I would be laughing at how lame and desperate to be relevant we are.  Brady was one thing, he is the GOAT you cant blame them for picking him up.  But Gronk too?  So very very cheesy.
fo4ca9w	1587501866	Raiders	nfl	Wow, so much to unpack. So hes not a STEM major? Huge red flag. What kind of doggo does he have? As an expert, he definitely sounds abusive. Did I mention Im an expert? You need therapy. Ill say it louder for the people in the back, but Occams Razor says that your brother is a manipulative, abusive, bipolar narcissist that is NOT wholesome. Full. Stop.
fo4caa7	1587501866	Jets	nfl	Real life Fantasy Football.
fo4cado	1587501868	Buccaneers	team	So this is what its like to feel fucking amazing in the offseason. I fucking love it!
fo4cagj	1587501869	Eagles	team	Dirty looks???? Bro cmon now, this is Philly legend BDN. You and me both know theyd get there asses beat.
fo4canl	1587501872	Patriots	team	Best bromance in the NFL reunited, all that matters
fo4capd	1587501873	Seahawks	team	Lets get these rings. Russ needs at least 6.
fo4cat5	1587501874	Bengals	nfl	Strap in tight buddy, we still got two days till the fun really begins!
fo4cawm	1587501875	Patriots	team	Had to be orchestrated. In 30 mins we went from rumours to Gronks already passed his physical.
fo4cay1	1587501876	Falcons	nfl	Yup! Because the Falcons are winning the division! Right?
fo4ca5c	1587501865	Patriots	team	Free 4th basically damn
fo4cah9	1587501870	Browns	team	TB is all in, if you get offered 14 for Hunt I rush to accept.  Love Hunt but for 1 year of a RB I absolutely do this.
fo4cajs	1587501871	Patriots	team	They do have an OJ on the squad so you never know.
fo4cao7	1587501872	Seahawks	nfl	Belichick did try to trade Gronk to the Lions in 2018. Gronk found out though before it happened and threatened retirement.
fo4cb0k	1587501877	Bengals	team	It seems like a lock but the team is notoriously tight lipped on things like the draftfree agency. It seems inevitable but Im like 90 percent confident.
fo4cajp	1587501871	Patriots	team	Hes won three Super Bowls here. He knows how business is handled in NE. Id think he prefers that to the Tampa Bay unknown. Bradys never had a losing season but hes also never not played for the Patriots. Lot of unknowns right now.
fo4camk	1587501872	Packers	team	4 of the first 5 picks in that draft are in the NFL Hall of Fame.
fo4capv	1587501873	Patriots	nfl	Saints fans are hella insecure right now
fo4casj	1587501874	Buccaneers	team	Arians might be a better coach than Kitchens
fo4casq	1587501874	Ravens	team	The original artist sued dying that the Ravens copyrighted his logo
fo4cay5	1587501876	Seahawks	nfl	And youre right!  Just happened.
fo4cazq	1587501876	Jets	team	Not gonna hate on you.  This sub can be rough.  The point of a Venn diagram is to help visualize the best choice among a given selection of choices.  Drafting a tackle is far and away the best choice.  Weve been circle jerking this topic so long guys are getting edgy!
fo4cb0d	1587501877	49ers	team	A 5th Round. We have a lot...
fo4cbay	1587501880	Jets	team	Vietnam flashbacks
fo4cayg	1587501876	Bills	team	Traitor to his hometown
fo4cb90	1587501880	Patriots	team	Imagine thinking were making the playoffs let alone the superbowl with our current roster and schedule, imagine being this delusional
fo4cbd9	1587501881	Patriots	nfl	Nah he just wants to play with Brady and he needed a year I guess. Im still worried about the guy... Id be surprised if he makes it past 33.
fo4cawl	1587501875	Chiefs	team	What is Keitzman up to now?
fo4cax7	1587501876	Vikings	nfl	Falcons r fucked.
fo4cayq	1587501876	49ers	team	That could backfire
fo4cb2z	1587501878	Vikings	nfl	Bucs Super Bowl confirmed
fo4cb72	1587501879	Chargers	nfl	610 weeks, 5 TDs before another nagging injury
fo4cbpr	1587501886	Eagles	nfl	Thanks for the reply. I think it will depend on the coaches grading of the big 3 . Bc if you see lamb or juedy as a OBJ, AB, Julio type guy then its worth it
fo4cbsb	1587501887	Dolphins	team	For dinner?
fo4cb7b	1587501879	Falcons	team	True, but thats situational and theres several areas of needs right now. A first round DE, CB, or DT instantly helps this team, with a LB or HB being secondary. The good and bad part of this entire thing is Atlanta has a lot of options right now with a lot of holes to fill.
fo4cbdc	1587501881	Bears	nfl	And will never have to be
fo4cbfw	1587501882	Giants	team	I was convinced we were going to pick OT until I noticed   we never even interviewed him and looked back. The lack of interest from the Giants just seems to extreme. Or you maybe youre right and I am trying to convince myself. Well find out soon enough. )
fo4cbiv	1587501883	Patriots	team	He was horrible in the pass game last year but was good his first 2 years. Hes also a phenomenal blocker.
fo4cbj2	1587501884	Seahawks	nfl	technically gronk never got busted so hes not in the program and the new CBA did give some concessions over weed (and other recreational drugs).
fo4cbmy	1587501885	Steelers	nfl	Yeah, I mean Im good with that. Set that locker room bomb off, dude.
fo4cbwr	1587501889	Packers	team	Im inclined to agree. He knows how much it sucked not getting along with Brett at first and he and Brett made an effort to make up for it. I dont think Aaron will waste any opportunity to ensure his successor is as good, if not better, than he is if he can.
fo4cbes	1587501882	Patriots	team	Lmao that goes to show how much you actually follow this team. Our 3rd4th founders tend to excel.
fo4cbzs	1587501890	Patriots	team	We had no leverage. If Gronk filed for reinstatement his cap hit of 12 million immediately hits the books and BB had to clear cap quick. He got a 4th rounder out of nowhere for a retired player.
fo4cbln	1587501884	Bears	team	I want him now and I want him to sit. By the time Foles or Trubiskys contacts are up, Jalen will be ready to go. If he doesnt work out, we can dump him and start over.
fo4cbmo	1587501885	Redskins	team	thats an exaggeration, nothing is longer than a cvs receipt.
fo4cc95	1587501894	Panthers	nfl	The draft is in 2 days. Plenty of players to choose from.
fo4cca8	1587501894	Packers	team	Gerald Willis had a ton of potential at miami. Talk about being a high draft pick was pretty common, but he had serious character concerns and only had one decent season
fo4ccat	1587501894	Buccaneers	team	Imagine the hot take in 2018 that in just two seasons Brady and gronk would be playing for the bucs
fo4cbvz	1587501889	Bills	team	Hey, at least its not in the AFC East...
fo4cc1a	1587501891	Patriots	team	I would be too but Im surprised given your previous comments.
fo4cc6w	1587501893	Buccaneers	team	And then they retire.  When the nfl comes back, Winston throws for 30 touchdowns and zero interceptions for someone else.  That would be the Bucciest Buc thing to happen.
fo4cc70	1587501893	Redskins	team	Who both were impending free agents. It wasnt a bad pick, youre using hindsight to discredit a guy with an elite track record in the draft because our incompetent organization fired him and then blamed it on his alcoholism (which may or may not be true but goes to show Bruce Allen had no problem burning bridges).
fo4ccas	1587501894	Patriots	team	Oh my god theyre becoming Patriots South
fo4ccb7	1587501894	Steelers	nfl	Belichick Asshole. Why Gronk hate? Because Belichick is a Bastard Man!!
fo4ccd5	1587501895	Colts	nfl	Wtf? not again
fo4ccmn	1587501899	Patriots	nfl	Gronc
fo4ccmr	1587501899	Patriots	team	Patriots win the AFC East this year.
fo4cbx1	1587501889	Patriots	team	Yeah just an easy move with no real leverage
fo4cc03	1587501890	49ers	nfl	Revis wasnt able to sustain his peak long enough to be the GOAT.  GOAT prime hes def in the discussion, but not overall GOAT
fo4cc1k	1587501891	Panthers	team	Luke no doubt. Norman, while definitely a good pick, has his value inflated based on his reputation vs what he actually did here. Normans peak was insane (arguably the best corner in the game) but he really only produced for 1.5 seasons as a Panther. And I genuinely have no clue who the 3rd awesome pick your referring to is? Nortman must be it, but he was a league average punter drafted in the 6th. Overall any draft with a HOF is a great draft, but this draft really wasnt as valuable to the Panthers as it appears on the surface.
fo4cc75	1587501893	Bears	nfl	And the 1st insider who reported on rumors of a potiental Gronk trade was a dog back on the 8th.httpsmobile.twitter.comLeroyInsiderstatus1248028390201974785
fo4cc85	1587501893	Buccaneers	team	BA already said he wouldnt bring in Brown, even for a veteran minimum contract. He has coached him before and has no desire to deal with that diva again
fo4ccea	1587501896	Redskins	nfl	Its a done deal.
fo4ccg6	1587501897	Eagles	team	So it could be us or half the league.
fo4cch4	1587501897	Chiefs	team	Not one hold either.
fo4cckv	1587501898	49ers	nfl	Does Arians really use Tight Ends?  I dont recall Arizona throwing the ball much to their TEs.He was the OC with Peyton and Dallas Clark though, right?
fo4cca3	1587501894	Packers	team	Willis became one of the most productive defensive linemen in college football in 2018. He was an Associated Press secondteam AllAmerican and secondteam AllACC selection, finishing among the nations leaders with 18 tackles for loss (among 59 total tackles with four sacks) in 12 games. NFL combine profile
fo4ccei	1587501896	49ers	nfl	Trading Buckner also frees up a ton of cap space for Kittles next contract.
fo4cchy	1587501897	Buccaneers	nfl	Undoubtedly, MossEvansWelkerGodwin
fo4cciy	1587501898	Chargers	nfl	Arent the players allowed to smoke weed now?
fo4cck4	1587501898	Jaguars	team	Youre giving a lot of credit to Tony
fo4ccm4	1587501899	Bears	nfl	How has nobody thought of what happens now to the prestigious WWE 247 championship?
fo4ccnz	1587501900	Ravens	nfl	Im not overly familiar with what the guys other offenses call receivers actually do. They just look like malnourished tight ends
fo4ccs9	1587501901	Buccaneers	team	Lmao I thought the same thing
fo4cceo	1587501896	Buccaneers	team	Lol true that, imagine having a 9 year career as a corner and never getting an INT.
fo4ccgw	1587501897	Raiders	team	2002 Sb Rematch
fo4ccjo	1587501898	Buccaneers	nfl	Bill Belichick has been traded to become the DC of the Bucs
fo4ccyw	1587501904	Buccaneers	nfl	Gronkowski juice mode.
fo4cd8h	1587501907	Redskins	nfl	Its pretty obvious the Buccs are going all in this year. Definitely going to be interesting to watch. Although Im always weary of teams getting a bunch of older players thinking they can just win like that (sorry for the boner killer at the end there).
fo4cdat	1587501908	Chiefs	nfl	My morbid curiosity over seeing him on the Chiefs would not be worth his bitching, Im sure.
fo4cdaw	1587501908	Redskins	team	That is true. I would be fine with Trent for Howard but obviously well have to see how the first round plays out. If the Buccaneers dont take a left tackle in round 1, then Id imagine that well trade Trent for Howard
fo4cdgs	1587501910	Patriots	nfl	Moving to a city where everybody said dont come here no one wants you and being unable to sell any PSLs in the stadium that youre renting has to be one of the worst executive decisions in National Football League history.The value of the franchise doubled.  Seems like a pretty solid move to me.
fo4ccwb	1587501903	49ers	nfl	I think a year plus off will have helped heal.  Hes obviously not fresh still, but his body has had time to recover a bit. He wont be as beaten up as he was when he retired.
fo4cd05	1587501904	Browns	team	Is Jake Burns the new Lane Adkins for this sub?
fo4cd08	1587501904	Patriots	nfl	Have you tried restarting your computer?
fo4cd3w	1587501905	Giants	team	I feel like wills is their number 1 guy (besides young who will be gone 2nd pick.
fo4cd4m	1587501906	Chargers	team	First, ew uniforms are damn good looking.Second, those are both womens jerseys in your picture.Third. Not the black for crying out loud.
fo4cd7f	1587501907	Dolphins	team	I...i am a huge Bama and Dolphins fan
fo4cd7x	1587501907	Buccaneers	nfl	Yep, if they can get wirfs at 14, or one of the other top 4 OT prospects theyll be in good shape. I doubt Thomas will be available but itll be interesting for sure.
fo4cd91	1587501907	Browns	team	i dont see any possible way we get 14. would be amazing but i dont see it
fo4cdf3	1587501910	Jaguars	team	Id trade the bears comp 4th pick we have for Howard so they can still have a 4th rounder.
fo4cdms	1587501913	Browns	nfl	I cant quit you!
fo4cdq5	1587501914	Patriots	team	Father Time and the offensive line has good chance of stopping their SB chances.
fo4cd40	1587501905	Jets	nfl	My dumb ass thought that Willis would go in rounds 24. Hes on his 3rd team now. Shows you why Im not a GM.
fo4cd5e	1587501906	Buccaneers	team	enjoy being irrelevant this season!
fo4cd5y	1587501906	Colts	nfl	NFL How many TEs do you want?Bears Yes
fo4cd90	1587501907	Buccaneers	nfl	Dude, OJs gone
fo4cdk7	1587501912	Buccaneers	team	I think Id take a 3rd. This year is lost anyways. Edelman has 2 years left in my opinion.
fo4cdkg	1587501912	Cardinals	team	Listened to that interview as well. Wouldve been crazyyyyy. I like where the 2020 Cardinals stand right now though
fo4cdr8	1587501915	Lions	team	I disagree, Id wager a lot of people are getting caught up with his combine performance when the point is that if he is playing at NT to replace Snacks like Id wager he would at least if I were running the team, rushing the passer is his secondary job, namely I just want his to tie up blocks and if he gets free collapse the pocket inside and force to the QB into the loving arms of Flowers and ideally if we trade down Epenesa who basically a better version potentially of Flowers. Then you rotate Epenesa in on third down if you playing a 43 with Brown at NT and Flowers at LDE and thats still great line. Basically I want them to build up the front seven, it would quicken the maturation of the back four or five scheme depending.As far as Simmons, blitz him often and make his athleticism a issue for the opposing OL, I really hope our new DC has taken plenty of notes from Schwartz as far as blitz packages and how to utilize them as Ive grown tired of the same ole rush three and surprised Pikachu face when the QB can proceed to make a five course meal with a clean pocket.Simmons could be a beast in either a 43 at SAM or 34 as a JOKER, he about the same size as Kyle Van Noy coming out of college and Clay Matthews too. The narrative that hes too small doesnt make sense to me, never mind that he could still put on weight and not lose much speed.
fo4cdtw	1587501916	Eagles	nfl	Oh come the fuck on.
fo4cdga	1587501910	Falcons	nfl	This sucks
fo4cdhc	1587501911	Redskins	team	OJ is not good
fo4cdl9	1587501912	Packers	team	Future Super Bowl Champions
fo4cdns	1587501913	Titans	nfl	Deion Sanders peak lasted longer
fo4cdoi	1587501913	Falcons	team	We should already have been going corner or Simmons but this just increases the likelihood that we are definitely going corner or Simmons
fo4cdth	1587501915	Saints	nfl	Were not insecure. Were just stating facts
fo4ce06	1587501918	Giants	team	Gotta love Ron Dixon. Best returner weve had and he stopped us from getting tabled by the ravens in SB35
fo4ce3p	1587501919	Falcons	nfl	httpsimgur.comAfBwcLR
fo4cdlb	1587501912	Patriots	team	I mean.. he shouldnt... But if he wants to play and risk serious long term injury to himself then its his funeral.
fo4cdu5	1587501916	49ers	team	They have Cameron Brate as well
fo4cdvb	1587501916	Falcons	nfl	UNSUBSCRIBE WHY WONT THE BAD MAN LEAVE IS ALONE
fo4ce8b	1587501921	Cowboys	nfl	When he spent the night at Tom rental in Florida, you know Tom got his guy.
fo4ce8j	1587501921	Falcons	nfl	Thats boring, you should have said something about 283 then i wouldve said something about double doink and then so on
fo4cebt	1587501922	Colts	nfl	And Quinn refuses to give him his Wifi password
fo4ce65	1587501920	Giants	team	Suddenly all NFCS teams looking at Simmons lol
fo4ce9j	1587501921	Patriots	team	Bottom 3 in scoring and bottom 4 in pass defense is what we consider great? Their run D was excellent last year but I think its a huge stretch to say theyre a great unit overall
fo4ce9s	1587501921	Redskins	team	Tampa just landed gronk, so maybe its more likely for OJ to come here
fo4ceas	1587501922	Chiefs	team	Ding ding ding
fo4cec9	1587501922	Panthers	team	Haha no way, we gotta eat crow same way TB has been taking a pounding for the last 5 years.
fo4cedm	1587501923	Vikings	team	Makes u think
fo4ceey	1587501923	Cowboys	team	We dont need a center
fo4cekk	1587501925	Eagles	nfl	lmaooo
fo4cenc	1587501926	49ers	nfl	Why is this era tougher?
fo4ceqq	1587501927	Jaguars	team	Mhmm
fo4ce8a	1587501921	Ravens	nfl	Yep. People blame Lamar but hes very low on the list in that game to me. How can you expect the QB to touch the ball on 80 plays and expect to win?
fo4ce94	1587501921	Patriots	nfl	I hope Rodgers and Adams fuck off to Jacksonville for nothing.
fo4cedj	1587501923	49ers	team	Ok ill tell john
fo4ceib	1587501924	Patriots	team	Im fucking disgusted. If I were a season ticket holder Id honestly consider giving up seats at this point. How in the world do you only get a 4th round pick, when we traded Sanu away for a SECOND?! At least get OJ Howard in return like what in the actual fuck.
fo4cejq	1587501925	Packers	nfl	I hate this stupid timelinehow come Gronk just gets to be like wah I wanna play with Tommy again ( and gets a trade just like thatun fuckin believable lmao
fo4ceir	1587501925	Falcons	team	Well obviously not. Despite our hatred for them we have to assume the Saints still win the division.
fo4ceno	1587501926	Buccaneers	nfl	I AM SO FUCKING EXCITED FOR THIS SEASON TO BE CANCELLED AND THIS TO BE THE GREATEST WHATIF IN SPORTS HISTORY. BUT ALSO TO WIN THE FUCKING SUPERBOWL LETS GO.
fo4cesf	1587501928	Buccaneers	team	Honey I shrunk my penis
fo4cezz	1587501931	Buccaneers	team	Really? Is that even possible as a DB? Lol
fo4ceo3	1587501927	Falcons	nfl	Stallworth was actually really solid
fo4ceqh	1587501928	Patriots	team	He forced his way out of a trade with the Lions a few years back saying hed retire before playing with a different QB
fo4ceuc	1587501929	Buccaneers	team	Yes he did, he said he wants to return to football and will only play for TB. Sources Retired Patriots TE Rob Gronkowski has told New England that hes interested in playing football again  and would want to do it with the Bucs and QB Tom Brady. A trade would have to be worked out for this to happen.(httpstwitter.comrapsheetstatus1252684831357632518?s21)His agent also put out a statement that he will honor his contract and play for the Buccaneers.Agent Drew Rosenhaus tells me, Rob has agreed to play for Tampa this season.  He will honor his current contract at this time. Gronk has taken his physical.(httpstwitter.comrapsheetstatus1252697465171652609?s21)
fo4cf5i	1587501933	Vikings	nfl	Do you really think youre that much smarter and knowledgeable than bob when it comes to football? How come there hasnt been a single report of a team willing to outbid az?What was the whole narrative when this story broke? How disloyal bob is, how could he trade away a pillar of the community just like that, Thats all mediafan jumping to conclusions. But now that deandre admits to seeking the trade, I guarantee there will not be one story about him turning his back on Houston or his teammates. What did I take a leap on?Thats the difference between me and everyone else, I dont give a shit about upvotes, I already knew everyone is blindly backing deandre. I was on boat in the beginning, screw bob, but then I actually started thinking about, outside the box, and I think you all have it wrong.
fo4cf5q	1587501933	Eagles	team	Cheating on a test and fighting a teammate? I dont care at all about either of those things.
fo4cf70	1587501934	Saints	nfl	The comment is basically anointing the Bucs NFCS champs when weve won it 3 years in a row and didnt lose anyone important
fo4cf7l	1587501934	Colts	nfl	OJ really isnt that good. Gronks blocking alone will be worth.
fo4cfeq	1587501937	Patriots	team	Heres the thing Clearly they wanted him though. Their offense doesnt use TEs in the passing game. You think they traded a 4th for an extra blocker on the line?Weve gotta stop doing the Danny Ainge defense for every move BB makes.
fo4ceuy	1587501929	Eagles	team	Could be a decent pick with 103, but I dont think that hes gotta be available at that point. Also I feel like theres other more pressing need than CB, but if we do get him that would still be great.
fo4cf09	1587501931	Packers	nfl	Something tells me Chicago isnt gonna roster Mitch Trubisky, Nick Foles and Cam Newton
fo4cfa6	1587501935	Patriots	team	Hes also 43. I love Tom, but it will be interesting to see the level at which he plays. Id bet hell be great, but that remains to be seen....
fo4cfj2	1587501939	Bears	nfl	OJ Howard to the Bears plz
fo4cfnf	1587501941	Broncos	team	Great practice for our playoff run, give it to me
fo4cfnt	1587501941	Patriots	team	To give Tom the whole game to throw.
fo4cf6i	1587501934	49ers	team	Bruh what. Taylor Gabriel over Henry Ruggs? delete this nephew.
fo4cffj	1587501937	Titans	team	us after reading this nonsense (httpsyoutu.beFkMWsOX7Y)
fo4cfhq	1587501938	Colts	team	Thought that was glow lol
fo4cfld	1587501940	Saints	nfl	Yup, if I dont see them smoking outside then idc
fo4cfmp	1587501940	Buccaneers	team	What the fuck is happening?
fo4cftg	1587501943	49ers	team	Thank You...
fo4cfxg	1587501944	Buccaneers	team	Lol I dont know a single Pats fan, including myself, who is not now a Bucs fan
fo4cfmw	1587501941	Bears	nfl	Gronk more so. His body was much more beaten and he hasnt played in a year. Brady is still an in shape and above average quarterback.
fo4cfpm	1587501941	Bengals	team	This is like getting 2 Christmas Mornings! We get the greatest quarterback of all time and the next Joe Thomas back healthy to protect him.
fo4cfv3	1587501943	Vikings	team	Jonathan Taylor has a ton of mileage, I wouldnt really want to touch him at as high of a position as some are suggesting.
fo4cfyk	1587501945	Redskins	team	They do still have Cameron Brate, though, who aint half bad. Maybe that makes OJ mildly expendable??
fo4cfin	1587501939	Ravens	nfl	LMFAOOOO IM DYING
fo4cfmz	1587501941	Bills	nfl	Gym rat... patriot way... unironically.
fo4cg8v	1587501948	Lions	nfl	Youve got to be shitting me. Hecantkeepgettingawaywithit.gif
fo4cgae	1587501949	49ers	nfl	Ok when does Edelman get traded to the Bucs for a third rounder
fo4cgb0	1587501949	Browns	nfl	Hey TB, give us 14 and I got a nice shiny Kareem Hunt for you! Go all in!
fo4cfx6	1587501944	Packers	nfl	I mean, you could have said Brady was 40 and Gronk was injuryprone right before they won a Super Bowl 14 months ago.
fo4cg29	1587501946	Patriots	nfl	Giving up a 7th doesnt make it free. Dumb trade. Belichick routinely hits on low round picks. They should have taken a 5 or 6th straight up instead of swapping picks. Adds no value whatsoever.
fo4cg7w	1587501948	49ers	nfl	He kinda lost some weight but i am sure hell gain it back so I think youre right
fo4cgdy	1587501950	Cowboys	nfl	Best part is he doesnt even notice it lol
fo4cggw	1587501952	Packers	team	It really just depends on the situation and draft position. You shouldnt expect a 5th round pick to contribute, you should expect a non QB top 5 pick to contribute.
fo4cgjm	1587501952	Bills	nfl	Imagine if they actually got AB as well...
fo4cglv	1587501953	49ers	nfl	FUCK MY LIFE INTO PIECES!!
fo4cgq4	1587501955	Chiefs	team	Ahh, the BJ Kisser days. Somebody misspelled his name in the comment section, and it stuck for a good while.
fo4cgd8	1587501950	Patriots	team	Maybe those idiots who say pats had all the leverage will stop. As soon as he signed the dotted line we have had to start extending or cutting guys and considering we didnt do that to chase weapons for the goat I doubt we would have did that for Gronk.
fo4cgdm	1587501950	Ravens	nfl	 I think that out of all the owners Dean Spanos of the LA Chargers has to be the worst out of the whole bunch. Boy, when you find out about Snyder your day is going to be ruined.
fo4cgfb	1587501951	Giants	nfl	So do we
fo4cgn5	1587501954	Raiders	nfl	This is my own private domicile and I will not be harassed.....bitch
fo4cgsz	1587501956	Giants	team	See thats the point of why I posted it. Discussion! Plus I like this idea.
fo4cgyi	1587501958	Patriots	team	You could have gotten something of value You did.  A 4th rounder.
fo4ch24	1587501960	Jets	nfl	The only reason were so defensive about it is because no one fucking listens. Even now, i speak the truth and get downvoted. The Jamal Adams trade rumors are fabricated by media thats bored to shit because of no sports and Cowboys fans too drunk on their own ego to do a cursory look at their own fucking salary cap and realize that they cant even afford him. Seriously, just go look at Jamals twitter account. Dude posts a bible verse and Cowboys fans jump on it to beg him to demand a trade to Dallas. Its pathetic. Look, if we trade him, thats on us. But as a whole, Jets fans are tired of being stepped on and joked about.
fo4ch2g	1587501960	Browns	nfl	LeBron James
fo4ch43	1587501960	Patriots	team	im 6 and 243 lbs.. can i be a NE TE?
fo4ch58	1587501961	Chiefs	team	yep. we were all boycotting 810 advertisers, writing letters to them to show we were rather than just let them see sales go down.
fo4cgcw	1587501950	Texans	nfl	Depends on if your OL coaching staff can coach up top prospects.... 
fo4cgd1	1587501950	Patriots	nfl	Im so happy we got a 4th for basically a 7th. GRONK was never going to play for the Pats again
fo4cgix	1587501952	Raiders	nfl	FROM DUNKIN DONUTS IN THE SNOW, TO CUBANOS ON THE BEACH. MOVIN ON UP, ROBERT GRONKOWSKI.
fo4cglu	1587501953	Eagles	nfl	Did Dan Snyder write this?
fo4cgom	1587501955	Cardinals	nfl	After years of throwing to Edelman, a backup tight end following a GRONK injury, and 5 other nameless receivers, Brady finally has weapons
fo4cguf	1587501957	Patriots	nfl	top 10 anime breakups of all time
fo4ch1i	1587501959	Patriots	team	Idk. Cant see it right now. Maybe mid season.
fo4ch9d	1587501962	Falcons	team	Not in the slightest. You dont make a draft decision based on a 31 year old always injured tight end coming out of retirement. With that being said though, I am pretty sure we were going to try and move up for OkudahSimmonsCJ regardless.
fo4cgsg	1587501956	Colts	team	People need to stop this Willis can be a better FS than Hooker nonsense. Willis does not have the range, instincts, ball skills, or athleticism of Hooker.
fo4ch63	1587501961	Patriots	team	Whats so bad about it? They can take the 90s era uni and upgrade it a little. Plus the equipment is better these days so it wouldnt look clunkyIm just saying, everyone wanted white helmets, and Im trying to think of why they kept silver, and I heard there was a one helmet rule?
fo4ch9q	1587501962	Steelers	nfl	Him adding weight is a sure thing.  Are you from Buffalo?  Many people in Buffalo are familiar with the Gronkowski family recipe for adding mass.  Hell have no problem getting bigger.  Youre right though, theres no guarantees in terms of productivity on the field here.
fo4cgzr	1587501959	Chiefs	team	Its a deep draft this year. I doubt a team is trading out of the first without getting a pick from this years draft. Along those same lines, Queen isnt worth that much draft capital over other LBs that will likely fall into the 2nd. Youre essentially giving up 2  1sts and a 4th for a small upgrade at one position.
fo4ch92	1587501962	Bears	nfl	nah, more like Gimli  very competitive
fo4chbx	1587501963	Steelers	nfl	yeah, they do!(httpsi.dailymail.co.ukipix20170403223EE89126000005784376814RollinthehayAfterthrowingaperfectstrikeBradyletloosea341491253613333.jpg)
fo4chkv	1587501967	Giants	team	Says page doesnt exist
fo4chms	1587501968	49ers	nfl	Honestly, his connection with Brady alone with be valuable, as long as he can stay on the field, which is no guarantee
fo4chee	1587501964	Chargers	nfl	Yeah but did you see the new jerseys 
fo4chhk	1587501965	Patriots	team	At this point Im waiting for him to holdout for a trade (
fo4chk8	1587501966	Raiders	nfl	I mean that was weak as hell too but Eli wasnt already under contract with a team.
fo4chon	1587501968	Patriots	team	Ive 100 madden drafted a rodrigo Blankenship and he was a superstar kicker so this cant go wrong
fo4chot	1587501968	Cowboys	nfl	Did rebus face fat better receivers?Rice, Irvin, Sharpe, Moore, Carter, Bruce, etc. can hold up against any era
fo4chrl	1587501969	Patriots	team	man as much as seeing him in a different uni is going to suck, its going to be even worse watching him get carted off again
fo4chu6	1587501970	Redskins	team	Trent faked it all.
fo4chwd	1587501971	Patriots	nfl	On the field or off?
fo4ci0i	1587501973	Patriots	nfl	Is gronk gunna be the WR3? Im no  expert but can it be healthy for him to bulk up to be a TE?
fo4chrn	1587501970	Chiefs	nfl	vietnam flashbacks
fo4chva	1587501971	Patriots	nfl	On paper. In a season where were still unsure if actual games will be played. That said, I sure hope it happens  that would be some electric offense down there to watch.
fo4chze	1587501972	Patriots	nfl	Lmfao the Bucs oline graded better than ours did last year and we won a super bowl with a bottom 3 pass blocking line
fo4ci2u	1587501974	Patriots	team	ego
fo4ci3y	1587501974	Bears	nfl	Wasnt it 2320 or something? Defense couldnt stop shit?
fo4chpx	1587501969	Bears	nfl	Dumb move imo. OJ is way cheaper than Gronk, more athletic, and far less injury prone at this point.
fo4chtm	1587501970	Steelers	nfl	Oh shit! I completely forgot! GO Gronk!
fo4chz0	1587501972	Jets	team	And now Gronk has returned
fo4ci05	1587501973	Patriots	team	Its a free Antonio Gibson, for someone retired, who BB wanted to trade last year to help a QB BB wanted to replace the year before. Go on a mock draft site and let it run on auto. Do you want that player? No cost, just salary. 13 picks.
fo4ci9g	1587501976	Patriots	nfl	Imagine if they had a RB
fo4cias	1587501977	Jaguars	team	Im sure its been said before, but we need to be talking to Tampa right now about Howard.
fo4ci2k	1587501974	Patriots	team	Shocking in the moment? Of course. When you think about it, not nearly as shocking
fo4cicb	1587501977	Patriots	team	This makes me sad.
fo4cih6	1587501979	Eagles	nfl	I think Hochuli needs to unretire too for this pinfall
fo4ciha	1587501979	49ers	team	Stop it! My penis can only get so hard!
fo4cikh	1587501980	Falcons	team	What? Gronk is the same age as Julio
fo4ciq8	1587501982	Patriots	nfl	httpsi.imgur.comjjgv3JI.jpg
fo4cir5	1587501983	Seahawks	team	I think the world of Metcalf, but Russ is a slightly better QB than the 3 Hopkins had to work with that year, and Metcalf wasnt playing across from a near HOF receiver grabbing 109 balls for 1400 yards (and hugely cutting down on available balls).
fo4ci81	1587501975	Patriots	nfl	Only if he reinstated, in which case we could still trade him and not be worried about it. And its not like we had to trade him to TB either.
fo4cice	1587501977	Buccaneers	team	ugh same. go bucs
fo4cidn	1587501978	Patriots	team	I remember starting out 2020 happy.  I was optimistic.  Was starting a new position in the emergency department.  I was looking forward to cheering on my boy Brady even if he was throwing to terrible receivers.  I just bought a house and was settled into my career enough to go relax at a beach or bistro on my weekends off.  I dont even want to think about what other shit is coming in Q3 and Q4.  Im too depressed already.
fo4cifm	1587501978	Lions	nfl	Im not questioning gronks choice, but Im questioning a bears fan deciding to talk shit about Detroit
fo4cijw	1587501980	Bears	team	Thats a false equivalency. Mahomes was a top 10 pick. Hurts is likely a bubble guy in the 2nd. Historically the difference between a 1st and 2nd round QB is about the same as the difference between a 2nd and a 7th rounder
fo4cikn	1587501980	Patriots	nfl	This is actually good for us
fo4cimq	1587501981	Patriots	team	He was in the retired reserve, his contract didnt count towards our cap.
fo4cinj	1587501981	Patriots	team	Related Tweet from Jason at OTC  Thats fair value for both sides. Patriots had no leverage in this spot.(httpstwitter.comJasonOTCstatus1252694727742406656)
fo4ciom	1587501982	Chargers	team	New uniforms are amazing, congrats. These helmets would be a great addition.
fo4civz	1587501984	Dolphins	team	Thanks man. The Herbert hate is a bit much imo. I hope we take him just to see the sub flip. Also, Id take the qb with no injury history and a great arm, but Im also thankful af my job is not riding on that decision lol
fo4cj01	1587501986	Bills	nfl	Bills vs Bucs Superbowl. Its destiny. Bills finally defeat Brady. Josh Allen scores a game winning goalline TD after fumbling the snap and becomes God Emperor of Western NY. Its the only way.
fo4cigc	1587501979	Steelers	nfl	Howard is a better blocker and receiver than Brate. With Gronk in tow the Bucs can run two TE sets with two TEs that are both highly capable blockers and receivers. Brate is for sure the odd man out and Howard will get paid when Gronk finally hangs them up.
fo4cio2	1587501981	Redskins	team	I see no reason not to offer a 5th
fo4ciuv	1587501984	Bears	team	Well if Mitch or Foles do well then he wont be in the field. If they cant we can get QBs through the draft and FA in 2021 and I think he would be a decent backup for whichever. I think no matter which QB we draft, theres gonna be a lot of red flags for, cause honestly the only QB I like is Burrows. But trading around to take him in a mid round would at least give us a backup QB who deserves a shot in whats is in my  opinion, a weak qb class. I prefer waiting till the 7th to draft someone, but anyone you draft, especially not in The first, will have red flags, more so later on, and even more so for QBs.
fo4civ7	1587501984	Bears	team	Eh, we ended up with Robbie a few years later. Jankowski is a fantastic kicker but hes a bigger dick head then he is a person.
fo4cj1a	1587501986	Raiders	team	Agree! Though I admit Ruggs is my least favorite option as I think our offense does not require over the top speed as opposed to solid route running.
fo4cj5o	1587501988	Packers	nfl	We used to do that all the time..its simply disaster recovery planning and implementing. Then, maybe 10 years ago, we ourselves said screw this office travel and now only have 7 out of 33 people in our office..all nice and productive, and not spending hours daily in traffic..) ..boink.
fo4cjd0	1587501990	Packers	nfl	Wait til they draft Taylor in the 2nd.
fo4cium	1587501984	Jets	team	Right like ive had meniscus surgery and thats my good knee now
fo4cizj	1587501986	Buccaneers	team	For what its worth, I have yet to see this sub or any Bucs fan be rude or disallowing to any Patriot fan who wants to jump ship. ALL ABOARD THE BANDWAGON!!!
fo4cj9e	1587501989	Vikings	team	He has to feel pretty burned from Treadwell.
fo4cjk3	1587501993	Patriots	nfl	Yeah I feel like Im taking crazy pills. Gronk has to be like 50lbs below his playing weight right now. Im not sure how this is going to work out, but this wont be the same Gronk we saw in the past... is there a chance maybe he ends up playing more of a WR role than actual TE?
fo4cj27	1587501987	Buccaneers	nfl	NFCS teams now redoing their draft boards looking to add linebackers with good coverage skills.
fo4cj3m	1587501987	Falcons	nfl	Can he even throw downfield to those receivers?
fo4cj4l	1587501987	Bills	team	Fuck Gronk and fuck Jarvis Landry.
fo4cj55	1587501988	Cowboys	team	He had to be with some of those O Lines
fo4cj71	1587501989	49ers	nfl	Ok when does Edelman get traded to Tampa for a third rounder lol
fo4cj82	1587501989	Patriots	nfl	No it isnt, he just said he couldnt wait to revisit the comment. The Saints could literally win the division, with Tampa still making the playoffs and being a offensive juggernaut.
fo4cjdx	1587501991	Chiefs	nfl	Because they might come back. If players get to become free agents just because they said Im retiring! jk. Imma go play where I want now there wouldnt be any point to contracts.
fo4cjij	1587501992	Patriots	nfl	Fuck this
fo4cjmi	1587501994	Ravens	nfl	Dan Snyder is a legit horrible person.Give Tepper more than 4 months before relegating him to evil status.
fo4cjpd	1587501995	Bears	nfl	Dude, this could be it, maybe him using pot to medicate his pain is a factor to him coming back.
fo4cjv5	1587501997	Redskins	team	Wow, one of the worst memes Ive ever see.
fo4cj79	1587501989	Patriots	nfl	If he looks good he is going to make a killing from his CBD endorsement.
fo4cjj0	1587501993	Patriots	team	I like the silver helmet, and I dont mind the new unis but I would like some white pants to just make more variants. Right now we have the fewest combos in the league
fo4cjnu	1587501995	Buccaneers	team	This offence is going to be scary with the options available
fo4cjt4	1587501996	Buccaneers	team	Let this dispell the nonsense that players cant get physicals done.
fo4cjml	1587501994	Raiders	team	Gronk is a concussion away from being an official potato
fo4ck1d	1587501999	Patriots	nfl	If you have the rights to a player who is retired and you dont have to move him, and they only want to go to ONE team, you have the leverage.  They dont need to trade him, and Brady is going to want him badly.  This is pretty straightforward.  If he was an active player in his prime holding out and they were counting on him it might be different. The Bucs (ie Brady) will want him badly and the Patriots dont have to do anything they dont want to do.
fo4ck5w	1587502001	Bears	team	No offense to your scouting abilities, but if you can see it Im guessing the pro scouts see this too, which is why he doesnt have  a top tier projection.
fo4ck67	1587502001	Bears	nfl	Me too
fo4ck7t	1587502002	Bears	nfl	Patriots flipped a retired player for a 4th round pick LMAO
fo4cjp8	1587501995	Colts	nfl	This is what Im rooting for, personally. Id give up a 4th rounder, as TB just gave theirs up.
fo4cjr7	1587501996	Patriots	team	At least a 3rd, maybe like a 3rd and a fifth or something.
fo4cjrs	1587501996	Texans	team	Pick up defensive pieces with 40 and 90, get KJ Hill if available in round 3 , if not wait till round 5 to pick up Hodgins
fo4cjw4	1587501998	Giants	team	Im a fan of the away jerseys. The red stripes and white jersey with the grey pants are sharp.
fo4cjws	1587501998	Patriots	team	I hope Tom crashes and burns. Fuck him for leaving
fo4cjzx	1587501999	Vikings	team	That would be awesome, it all depends on who falls. We could definitely us some help on the Dline and we really need help on the Oline
fo4ck17	1587501999	Giants	nfl	Not sure if this is a jab at wired mouse(s) but the response time is faster if it is.
fo4ck5a	1587502001	Lions	team	two wideangle monitors sidebyside instead of one ultrawide 180degree monitor?lmao, peasant.
fo4ck9h	1587502003	Broncos	team	On reflection, yeah Im not sure what I was talking about. But Id still like to enjoy some new hype.
fo4ckap	1587502003	Patriots	team	Anyone whos angry AT gronk. Take a step back, a deep breath, and literally go fuck yourself you 11 year old fucking losers.
fo4ckgd	1587502006	Patriots	team	The only thing that happened to the city of boston was the bombing lmfaoooo
fo4ck6d	1587502002	Titans	team	But can it run Crisis
fo4ck7w	1587502002	Patriots	team	That he is. Also a very solid coach
fo4ck8p	1587502002	Bills	nfl	Agreed, I literally dont give a fuck what those two do down there.
fo4ck9s	1587502003	Patriots	team	Can someone explain to me why they would only want a fourth round pick? Gronk is a HOF TE and it doesnt make sense thats all they get for him...
fo4ckl0	1587502007	Patriots	team	Yeah a free 4th rounder is always good. Was just surprised at 1st. When you think of it that way. Giving up a 7th and a player that wasnt going to suit up for a 4th isnt bad. Now that I thought about it more. Really no leverage because its only one team to make a deal with. It wouldve been nice if we got OJ Howard someway in the deal.
fo4ckmk	1587502008	Cowboys	nfl	Arians seems like the type to sit in a dark room and smoke a cigar
fo4ckmy	1587502008	Bears	nfl	Gronk blocking is gonna get him hurt so fast.
fo4ck75	1587502002	Patriots	team	Id have traded a 4th for Calvin Johnson in a heartbeat a couple of years ago.
fo4ckgm	1587502006	Falcons	team	Preach, brother.
fo4ckks	1587502007	Broncos	nfl	Champ Bailey was better than Revis overall
fo4ckpm	1587502009	Patriots	team	 This
fo4cku1	1587502011	Giants	nfl	Price. All three of those Ravens players were on cheap contracts. Brate is getting 6 millionyear. Im sure Gronk will command a decent salary. OJ is owed 2 million this year. No reason to invest that much to that position when two will suffice plus some practice squad player.
fo4ckvx	1587502012	Panthers	team	Throwback to when people thought CMC was an early 2nd rounder
fo4ckyd	1587502013	49ers	team	It would be fun to see him in Kyles offense.
fo4ckhz	1587502006	Buccaneers	nfl	hohoho hahaha lets try 4 interceptions a game, the make up of this team is making Tampa excited for football again.
fo4cknb	1587502008	Eagles	nfl	Plus he would clock the shit out of the ballcarrier and you dont see Deion or Regis doin that
fo4cknw	1587502009	Buccaneers	nfl	Uhhh, Deion had to cover a Prime Rice. He also played elite defense for WAY longer than Revis.
fo4ckop	1587502009	Eagles	nfl	I feel bad for a lot of the people who just grew up that way. Racism isnt a human nature it is taught and while it can be unlearned it is hard. It must be exhausting always having that hate though. This makes the Nuk and BoB thing even more weird to me. If Nuk could have some sort of positive relationship with McNair why couldnt BoB. Was it because one of them didnt want to have one? Or did they have a negative one and Nuk doesnt want to air that laundry in public? Its interesting.
fo4ckor	1587502009	Lions	team	Oh, its kinda hard to detect sarcasm through text.
fo4ckpu	1587502009	Patriots	nfl	Because he got tired of Bill. (
fo4ckvi	1587502012	Rams	team	There are dozens of us! But definitely agree, the Silence of the Rams speaks volumes. They marketed this wrong from the start. Hopefully they just blow us out of the water when they reveal the jerseys... whenever that might be.
fo4cl0i	1587502014	Patriots	team	Solid run D but their pass defense and points allowed stats are atrocious
fo4cl3u	1587502015	Cowboys	nfl	It wasnt a live play, so youre objectively wrong there. And if thats what you need to win, a penalty on a bench player that didnt affect play in the field, then you can have it. But that never gets called.
fo4cl6v	1587502016	Patriots	team	Tampa Baytriots
fo4cl7j	1587502017	Buccaneers	team	The season is getting played.
fo4ckpq	1587502009	Falcons	team	Cant wait to see them get their fucking asses KICKED in the NFC
fo4cks0	1587502010	49ers	team	Ruggs is speed only. we have that type of player already on the roster. A 13th for that? Hell no...
fo4ckxp	1587502013	49ers	nfl	It 100 would be. Their third best WR would be the best on almost every other team lmao.
fo4cl24	1587502015	Patriots	team	Im with you
fo4cl5h	1587502016	Seahawks	nfl	Hernandez was quite the bullet.
fo4clbq	1587502018	Patriots	team	Fuck you and your pink hat.
fo4cl00	1587502014	Patriots	team	Exactly. I dont see why the Bucs would want to give him up. Hes a great pass blocker.
fo4cl1a	1587502014	Ravens	nfl	Cant wait to see R Truth rushing the field during the opener to pin Gronk in the end zone
fo4cl32	1587502015	Patriots	team	That wasnt my take but it could still be the right one. Just because Gronk comes back doesnt mean its the smart thing to do. The jury is still out on that
fo4cl7g	1587502017	Ravens	nfl	Holy shit
fo4cl9j	1587502017	Packers	nfl	Gotta imagine OJ Howard is all but gone at this point
fo4clbb	1587502018	Broncos	team	Solid
fo4clpa	1587502024	Patriots	nfl	Weed policy changed.
fo4cls9	1587502025	Buccaneers	nfl	JUST LET US HAVE FUN FOR ONCE
fo4cluo	1587502026	Patriots	team	Im confused, does this mean hes out of retirement?
fo4clbw	1587502018	Patriots	nfl	Scared about what? I would guess upward of 60 pats fans would love to see BradyGronk win another superbowl.
fo4cldw	1587502019	Giants	team	Cant wait to play the bucs s
fo4clrd	1587502024	Jets	team	Seriously. He has to say that. He very well could have a defensive player on top of his board but still drafts an offensive player.
fo4clni	1587502023	Steelers	nfl	A 7th rounder is a low probability pick. Regardless of his history, getting a 4th is pretty solid.
fo4clom	1587502023	Patriots	nfl	I agree with the facemask argument. But arguing that a bad call isnt a big deal because other unrelated stuff happened in the game is stupid. However, arguing that there was a missed call that favored the Lions in the same play, which cancels out the bad call that hurt them, is a good argument.
fo4clpx	1587502024	Dolphins	nfl	No.End.
fo4clux	1587502026	Jets	team	Every gm says they are going to take the best player available
fo4clvb	1587502026	Patriots	team	This is the dumbest thing Ive ever read
fo4clwb	1587502026	Patriots	team	They got the draft capital to fix one of those problems.
fo4cm59	1587502030	Saints	nfl	The original comment is literally Goodnight NFC South
fo4cmbo	1587502032	Patriots	nfl	Ruggs to the Raiders would be the most Al Davis pick.
fo4clpj	1587502024	Patriots	team	The saltiness comes from having our favorite players team up on another team. I think this is a good move, getting a decent return for a guy that never would have come back to us. Cant help but think Jules isnt asking for a move as well, and maybe developing a young receiving corps with some young wideouts is what we need
fo4clt0	1587502025	Patriots	team	Loyalty, just not to the Patriots
fo4cltb	1587502025	Lions	nfl	Imagine being a life long Bucs fan, adding possibly the best QB and TE to ever play the game, and potentially not even being able to see them play in person this year.
fo4clzc	1587502027	Panthers	team	Just enjoy the chaos.
fo4cm15	1587502028	Giants	nfl	Has the NFL ever actually made a determination?  He has reports of DV, the assualt associated with the moving company recently.  If if were fact that he would serve a 46 game suspension, there would be interest, but no one wants him shelved on the exempt list eating up cap.
fo4cm2t	1587502029	Patriots	team	Im all for it. The more picks the better, I just want the Pats to hit on all there draft picks lol...
fo4cmdc	1587502033	Chiefs	nfl	Watch them draft Kmet and produce him to be a stud...
fo4cmfs	1587502034	Patriots	team	Whats more likely Bill drafts a player who will contribute day 1 with that pick or that he takes a backup offensive lineman that gets cut before opening day of 2021?
fo4cmn6	1587502037	49ers	nfl	...sigh.
fo4clzz	1587502028	Titans	team	Wow that is a great price! Thanks for the link! I just ordered one for my whole family.
fo4cmk3	1587502035	Patriots	nfl	Didnt he lose like 40lbs of muscle since he retired?
fo4cmod	1587502037	Bengals	team	pls
fo4cma0	1587502032	Colts	team	Your meme is quite impressive. You must be very proud.
fo4cmmk	1587502036	49ers	nfl	GronkBrate
fo4cmon	1587502037	49ers	nfl	Denial is not just a river in Egypt
fo4cmr8	1587502038	Colts	nfl	One might even say that the 2011 tight ends were killer.
fo4cmve	1587502040	Giants	nfl	Yes.  And he knows how to play with Brady.
fo4cn3a	1587502043	Bears	nfl	dont the Pats have his rights?
fo4cmcd	1587502032	Patriots	team	How does a Gronk trade change any circumstances of the season? Why would this trade mean that we should now tank for Trevor?
fo4cmkf	1587502035	Panthers	nfl	I said probably never. As in, most people dealing with what cams dealing dont recover. Thats just history. Its remarkable how everyone was predicting that this was how cams career would end, and now that its happening, everyone wants to act like hes totally gonna bounce back.Its probably not gonna happen. Hes probably gonna get hurt again wherever he goes next and that will be it.You guys really didnt do anything to help him during those years eitherOh, Im well aware. Not sure what that has to do with the future, though
fo4cmm3	1587502036	Ravens	nfl	The very first game he got less than 10 targets hed probably threaten to punch our GM.And we dont pass a lot so I dont think that would take long.
fo4cmm5	1587502036	Patriots	nfl	 TBs 4th was worth 60 points on the Jimmy Johnson draft chart. NEs highest 7th was worth 1 pt.Based on the same chart, 23 overall (where NE picks) is worth 760.  Dallas has 17 (950) and Miami has 17 (900).  If either one said we could trade up with them and only give a 7th rounder, I would make that trade 100 times out of 100.
fo4cmmi	1587502036	Jaguars	team	Depends on the cost of moving from the 3rd to a midlate 2nd rounder. If it wont set us back, where we can walk away with an OT, WR, and DB (excluding Dobbins)? I am more open to that. Ideally, my top 2 picks would be Lamb and Thomas. DB, maybe someone like Bryce Hall or the guy from Utah in the 2nd round. Lamb, Thomas, Hall, and Dobbins would be a great start to a draft.
fo4cms5	1587502039	49ers	nfl	Seriously, this sort of honestly pisses me off. And it further feels like a betrayal by 2 of our greatest players. It feels like they planned this out well in advance.I know, worlds smallest violin and all that.
fo4cmsh	1587502039	Patriots	team	He was physically destroyed by the end of the SB run. Needed time to recover physically and mentally, did so for a year. At this point, clearly the pats dont make sense for someone looking for another year or two in the league. He busted his ass and gave us a ton of incredible memories, now hes taking an opportunity to go play with Tom and make another run at it. The pats tried to trade him in his final year.  I cant get angry and gronk at all here. This does nothing to tarnish his legacy with NE. BB runs an extremely effective program but its one that doesnt incentivize most players to stick around towards the end of their career. You take the good (winning) with the bad (almost no storybook career endings).
fo4cmtd	1587502039	Patriots	team	Something is fucked up in New England. Two staple players for us just decided to up and leave. I get Gronk retiring for health but his sudden decision to come back now just screams that something is wrong with the organization.
fo4cmnp	1587502037	Patriots	team	hey Im not the 8 time super bowl champ, are you?
fo4cmqm	1587502038	Redskins	nfl	Buccs gonna be good but Im not sold yet. Theyre depending on Brady still being Brady at his age and without Belicheck and sad to say but Gronk is injury prone and getting old (for football) at this point.
fo4cmym	1587502041	Ravens	nfl	Sanders had more interceptions for more yards and more TDs. He also played on offense. And has more recieving touchdowns. He has more career tackles. Has more superbowl rings and clearly had a larger impact on teams he was on. Plus his personality makes him stand out. Theyre both great no doubt. But when it comes to clear impact, Sanders wins.
fo4cnfy	1587502048	Raiders	nfl	Wait whats going on? Who?
fo4cn6b	1587502044	Lions	nfl	How I imagine every pick going(httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vzSWUWPx2VeQt224)
fo4cn98	1587502045	Seahawks	nfl	His blocking was top 10 easily, probably number 1. Theres no stats needed to prove Gronks blocking hes quite clearly always gonna be elite there and Im sure his TDs would be higher if he played more and even then yards are way more important. Erick Enron had the most TDs that year but hes clearly worse than Kittle.
fo4cnfw	1587502048	Patriots	team	He might play WR no?
fo4cngy	1587502048	Ravens	team	I hope he jukes the curse like he jukes defenders!
fo4cniy	1587502049	Patriots	team	Who is next, Edelman?
fo4cn5g	1587502044	Raiders	nfl	Be aware that if both Brady and Belichick have losing records, my cum will launch high enough to knock a satellite from orbit
fo4cn5j	1587502044	Patriots	team	Well see
fo4cnak	1587502046	Patriots	team	Fuck Gronk
fo4cnjt	1587502049	Patriots	nfl	Man, I got to do laser timed 40s with a few friends a couple months ago. It does a good job of putting in perspective just how fast these guys are. Im not a terrible athlete, and my best was a 5.22. Basically, Im as fast as Tom BradyMy friend who I consider a spectacular athlete by any normal persons standard was the fastest of the bunch at a 4.89. Great to know that a guy who is 60 195lbs and a REALLY good athlete is considerably slower that 300lb Terron Armstead.
fo4cndf	1587502047	Lions	team	Gronk and a seventh for a fourth
fo4cnex	1587502047	Dolphins	nfl	Doesnt the WWE have a facility in that area?
fo4cnlq	1587502050	Patriots	team	I think it should be the Buccaneer bending over Pat the Patriot because thats how I feel right now.
fo4cnmf	1587502050	Patriots	team	You are greatly, GREATLY overestimating Gronks current worth.
fo4cnte	1587502053	Falcons	team	Gronk isnt washed he just cant stay healthy for the life of him
fo4cnvb	1587502054	Patriots	nfl	You make it too easy (httpscdn.newsday.compolopolyfs1.9892147.1422851132!httpImageimage.JPGgenderivativeslandscape768image.JPG)
fo4cny3	1587502055	Packers	team	i came here for this
fo4co6c	1587502058	Patriots	team	Youre forgetting the fact that we had one big contributor from a draft 20 years ago.This is not only ahistorical, but wrong. Do you understand what roster management is?Youre also forgetting the myriad of free agent signings.Citation needed. Find me a team made of only  free agent signings aside from the QB. Ill wait. Look at the list of people weve drafted in the last 7 years see how many big contributors to that run you find. You wont find a whole lot, I can tell you that.I look forward to you twisting big contributors to mean whatever fits your delusional argument, but how about Jamie Collins, Logan Ryan, Duron Harmon, Bryan Stork, James White, Trey Flowers, Shaq Mason, Joe Cardona, Joe Thuney, Malcolm Mitchell, Elandon Roberts, Ted Karras, and Sony Michel (yes). If you truly believe that Brady won the last three rings entirely on his own surrounded by only FAs, you need more help than he did last season.
fo4cnoi	1587502051	49ers	nfl	Hes 30 years old. Not a lot of productive TE in that age range. Resting a year doesnt remove all the injuries he had in the 8 previous years.
fo4cnor	1587502051	Chiefs	nfl	You think he still has the ability to be an elite blocker? The dude is smaller now than when he used to play and a year off could be just as bad for him as it is good for him. You might have some really high expectations
fo4cnt9	1587502053	Browns	team	Hypothetical 3 way trade involving only players  WAS sends us Trent Williams, we send Kareem Hunt to TB, and TB sends OJ Howard to WAS. Winners all around.
fo4cnwj	1587502054	Bears	team	There are VERY few elite QBs in the midlate 2nd round
fo4co79	1587502058	Rams	nfl	i think you replied to the wrong comment my man
fo4cnu9	1587502053	Dolphins	nfl	He realized that Vince McMahon was even more evil than Bill B and needed to get out of their immediately
fo4co5v	1587502058	Seahawks	nfl	Waiting for the inevitable Durant in a Bucs jersey that someone is going to proudly post here.
fo4coek	1587502061	Patriots	team	Dont call people idiots for advocating for something sports related. Holy crap, stop the toxicity, its just sports
fo4co8f	1587502058	Bills	team	I guess the Saints are my NFC team this year (Assuming there is a season)
fo4coh6	1587502062	Cowboys	nfl	Wanting the dude who was the best receiver in the game and is on good enough terms with you to work out with you on his own time is dumb now?
fo4coib	1587502062	Bills	nfl	Ruggs would be such a fun toy in SF
fo4coc2	1587502060	49ers	team	Oj Howard might be one of the most overrated players in the NFL. Hes had lackluster production dating back to his Alabama days despite playing on stacked offenses. And since hes a former 1st round pick, someone will almost certainly overpay for him and I hope its not us.
fo4codj	1587502060	Steelers	nfl	Champppppp dude was just untouchable. Law was a little less shut down but more of a ball hawk.
fo4coip	1587502063	Patriots	team	What name to they want Tampa Bay patriots or the bay state patriots (ik bay state is in Massachusetts so dont bother saying)
fo4colp	1587502064	Vikings	nfl	Washington should take some notes, this is how you deal with a player that wants out. Take what you can get and move on.
fo4couc	1587502067	Lions	team	Were probably letting both walk after this season and drafting their replacements in the first 2 rounds s
fo4coug	1587502067	Bears	team	Howard for Shaheen and 2021 4th Rounder, who says no?
fo4cojt	1587502063	Bengals	nfl	Definitely but everyone on that 160 team just looked insane that year.
fo4cok6	1587502063	Patriots	team	Why in the world would we just pass on free much needed draft capital? Spite? This is dumb logic IMO.
fo4cols	1587502064	Jets	nfl	httpsi.imgur.comgT83EWF.gif?noredirect
fo4cop7	1587502065	Ravens	nfl	I used to think that I could not go on
fo4cowo	1587502068	Bears	nfl	I mean.. Im 511 and 200 lbs and I might be able to do as much damage if I had a wide open X on his chest with his head turned lol
fo4coz6	1587502069	Giants	nfl	D  D is writing for the Texans.
fo4cp2s	1587502071	Patriots	nfl	Okay but this idea that arians never liked the guy is ludicrous
fo4cok7	1587502063	Patriots	team	The Bucs went 79 last year with their QB throwing 30 picks and practically throwing 7 points to the other team every game. They also have one of the best run defenses in the league... theyll definitely be a playoff contender.
fo4cp3q	1587502071	49ers	nfl	so do we
fo4cpg1	1587502076	Buccaneers	team	I am not a fan of it either.  We are like that desperate kid who will do anything to be allowed to sit at the cool kids table.
fo4coyb	1587502069	Ravens	nfl	At least they can terrorize the NFC now
fo4coz3	1587502069	Bills	nfl	I dont doubt that he can add the weight, its the physical problems that come along with adding that weight in the short amount of time needed. It took the dude years of work to get his muscle mass to where it was and now he has to add that weight by the season
fo4coz7	1587502069	Chiefs	nfl	He also has a mean edge to him in contact so that will certainly help..
fo4cp0f	1587502070	Buccaneers	team	There are a few... normal for any sub tho. Yall are a fun group
fo4cpi6	1587502077	Jets	team	Chase Young is top on almost every board lol
fo4cpn3	1587502079	Patriots	team	Letting your 2 best players, faces of the franchise, in team history walk and go to win another SB together is not okay.
fo4cp7v	1587502073	Patriots	nfl	Gronk was peeing blood or something like that in some stories in his last year with the pats.
fo4cpc0	1587502075	Buccaneers	team	Lol incredible
fo4cpdq	1587502075	49ers	nfl	Are you really hungry or just bored?
fo4cpjb	1587502077	Titans	team	Shoulda coulda woulda, DH won the title.
fo4cplv	1587502078	Colts	team	Hello there
fo4cpre	1587502080	Patriots	nfl	4th.
fo4cpfw	1587502076	Buccaneers	nfl	Jameis holds the ball, Brady throws it quick
fo4cpgj	1587502076	Jets	team	You should always draft BPA in the first round. I vehemently disagree with drafting strictly for need. Now, you should build you big board with positional value in mind. Also, this doesnt scream WR1  OT4 to me.
fo4cplf	1587502078	Patriots	nfl	Says the Jets fan
fo4cpqw	1587502080	Patriots	team	Nothings changed. Bill wouldnt tank, wont tank, isnt going to tank.
fo4cpsq	1587502081	Patriots	team	This feels like the Celtics trading Garnett and Pierce to the Nets for an insane amount of draft picks
fo4cpwe	1587502082	Patriots	team	I agree with this 100. He and Drew Bledsoe  and eventually Kraft   kept this team from an impending offseason move to St. Louis. I still have all the newspapers in a storage bin in my basement. That was just about as amazing a story as the Brady era turned out to be. TUNA!!!
fo4cq41	1587502085	Broncos	nfl	I predicted that Gronk and Andrew Luck would be back.
fo4cpf7	1587502076	Saints	team	after the game with the 49ers last year and that terrible last play at stopping Kittle... I think Payton might reconsider for a top LB
fo4cpj4	1587502077	Patriots	nfl	They should just trade for White. Fully commit to being the new Patriots
fo4cppf	1587502080	Bears	team	1. He could realistically be there in the second.2. He has improved every year hes played.3. He is actually very accurate according to this thread.(httpstwitter.comBrettKollmannstatus1250998800723800066)4. Hes an athlete, and has competed against the best in college football (with a lot of wins).5. Hes learned two different offenses in college, and seemed to handle the transition well.6. Has CONFIDENCE (which I think might be Trubiskys greatest weakness)
fo4cq0z	1587502084	Falcons	team	What an ignorant thing for you to say, uhobosockmonkey Im glad that people can begin to love their lives again. The pandemic is slowing down and despite what everyone is saying , the economy crashing is going to seriously hurt a lot of people. Getting back to work is key to keeping the economy running.
fo4cq9f	1587502088	Patriots	team	A big part of it was probably the CBA.  Gronk said he didnt want to play if he couldnt smoke weed, the new CBA allows him to.
fo4cpwz	1587502082	Buccaneers	team	Gronk had an underwhelming final year due to injury, but he still made every single clutch catch that lead the pats to their 6th ring.His numbers were still solid and he was still a top 10 TE. If hes on the field with this offense after a full year of rest AND cbd oil is allowed now to help him with pain, hes gonna be BIGtime.
fo4cpx3	1587502083	Vikings	team	And what team will prefer trading for Kirk (and his salary) when they couldve drafted Tua themselves?  I could happen, I suppose.  But if 20 teams passed on Tua (and Cam  Jameison are unsigned), it seems unlikely that we could (easily) trade Kirk.
fo4cpxm	1587502083	Buccaneers	team	fuck off
fo4cpyz	1587502083	Packers	team	Im shook
fo4cq40	1587502085	Patriots	nfl	Tom gets Gronk. We get a fourth for a guy that wasnt gonna play for us. Love Gronk and Brady. Good trade for both teams
fo4cqc5	1587502089	Bills	team	I hate Brady and Belichick like you would hate an older brother for just constantly clowning on you. My hatred for Gronk is on an entirely different level.
fo4cqey	1587502090	Browns	team	Hes cheap and theyd need to overpay to get him from us. Same with OBJ for that matter, it doesnt matter what the market is, when theres higher value when hes on your roster.
fo4cq4i	1587502086	49ers	nfl	Inb4 Chiefs get mahomes another weapon in the draft or in a trade
fo4cqgb	1587502091	Redskins	nfl	Holyyyyy shiittttt
fo4cqip	1587502092	Buccaneers	team	he was still an elite blocker. and made the offensive play of the game in the SB
fo4cqra	1587502095	Buccaneers	team	Might as well let him go shiit. We need to rebuild in this draft and if Belichick can hit on these picks will be back sooner than later.
fo4cqdt	1587502090	Cowboys	nfl	Just need a half decent RB then?
fo4cqfa	1587502090	Buccaneers	nfl	OJ Howard is the most overrated player ive ever seen. dudes done fuck all and people act like hes a top 3 TE
fo4cqhg	1587502091	Patriots	team	Please stop rooting for the patriots if this upset you that much, honestly fuck yourself
fo4cqhu	1587502091	Seahawks	nfl	Saying hes top 3 may be a stretch but saying hes not top 10 is a much bigger stretch.
fo4cqj7	1587502092	Chiefs	nfl	Yeah dude you guys made out like bandits. Kudos!
fo4cqku	1587502092	Panthers	team	I read somewhere that there arent any GMs that draft consistantly better than anyone else.  Its a numbers game.  NE has had a lot of bad draft picks, but they consistently trade down and collect picks, hitting on 50 of 8 picks is better than hitting on 50 of 4 or 6 picks.  Marty had a few years he traded up and gave up picks.I think a good GM collects picks, and manages salariescontracts.  Drafting is a numbers game.
fo4cqnm	1587502094	Ravens	nfl	I doubt you keep OJ.
fo4cqox	1587502094	Patriots	team	This trade is an absolute gift from Gronk. We essentially traded a 7th for a 4th directly, as Gronk would have done nothing for us otherwise. The lack of football knowledge on this sub is astounding.
fo4cqrm	1587502095	Buccaneers	nfl	Hoisting or fisting?
fo4cqvv	1587502097	Saints	nfl	Yes but then Bradin Cooks was somehow worth a first round pick in three separate drafts.
fo4cqzj	1587502098	Patriots	team	Not trying to puff out my chest.it was a stupid and pointless post, my statement was simply that he cant come back and just sign with the Bucs because the Pats own his rights, which would mean he would need to be traded.Nothing I said was innacurate, so not sure why you dumb asses needed to come back and respond to a 2 week old post like children as if to say nah nah you were wrong when I wasnt actually wrong.
fo4cr1l	1587502099	Chargers	nfl	Who is we? Im genuinely asking since you dont have a flair haha
fo4cr23	1587502099	Vikings	team	Badger Fan. JT also never missed a game in 3 years. While I get the concern hes shown no durability issues at all. Was renowned as a leader and weight room guy. If we can get a nice haul for Dalvin. Id be cool taking him in the 2nd with no reservations.
fo4cr2m	1587502100	Jaguars	team	Do it.
fo4cqh9	1587502091	Bills	nfl	so slow, yet so elusive
fo4cql3	1587502093	Broncos	nfl	Eli to the Panthers!?
fo4cqoc	1587502094	Texans	nfl	Yes, but god forbid someone have a rational take that looks at the big picture.
fo4cqqx	1587502095	Buccaneers	team	You dont think Brady already talked to all them about it? Probably one of his request.
fo4cqr0	1587502095	49ers	nfl	Im sure he has to add some weight to be able to absorb hits...im just curious to see how much though.Because of his 10M or so salary im not sure hes going to be playing just situational snaps.  I guess well see though
fo4cqri	1587502095	Redskins	team	Lower body injuries arent nearly as serious as back injuries and concussion. Trent also didnt have a brain tumor lmao
fo4cqtx	1587502096	Raiders	nfl	Nah, Ruggs is actually a good WR to go along with the speed.
fo4cqv1	1587502096	Cardinals	team	Arguably number 1, I mean dude does NOT drop a pass, I think hes better than Julio now (and hop wins games, Julio quite frankly doesnt but Im not saying he isnt a generational talent) and with AB out of league I think its safe to call Hopkins the best for now. Mike Thomas might beat him out this year but still
fo4cqvd	1587502096	Packers	nfl	Pass
fo4cqx8	1587502097	Falcons	team	Only Henderson will allow us to acquire multiple starters for the defense.Stay at 16 and take one of Henderson, Kinlaw, Chaisson, Murray or Queen. At least three of them will be there.
fo4cr2o	1587502100	Seahawks	nfl	Elway texting him the word constantly every 5 minutes
fo4cr74	1587502102	Patriots	team	They dont need receivers though. Bucs would be silly to take him
fo4crea	1587502104	Packers	nfl	I mean if Rodgers plays to an MVP level, theres always a little bit of hope. Never underestimate the bad man. I admit, Im a little less optimistic now.
fo4crem	1587502104	49ers	team	With KC being KC, New Orleans adding Sanders and potentially another WR in the 1st, and now Tampa adding BradyGronk to go with 2 elite WR1s, we need to make our offense more explosive if we want to compete with these other top tier offenses. Even the best defenses will have trouble holding these offenses in check for an entire game.I hope Lynch grabs a WR at 13 and still trades for Engram or Howard. Id put us up against anyone if we added those weapons.
fo4cr1e	1587502099	Eagles	team	Seems like the classic case of radio station personality making things up to get the attentionlistenership
fo4cr1s	1587502099	Patriots	nfl	Total win for NE. Loved the guy when he was here but he was not worth his contract at the end.
fo4cra5	1587502103	Patriots	nfl	Edelmans about to put himself on seasonending IR and will only come off it if the Patriots trade or cut him.
fo4crjj	1587502106	Raiders	nfl	I feel like Al Davis picks are prioritizing speed over the player, not just picking talented players that are also fast lol
fo4crmd	1587502108	Bengals	team	They dont sell enough merchandise right now to justify a uniform change, and we know Mike Brown is all about that green.
fo4cr2l	1587502100	Browns	team	I think Jake might just be messing around but Ill entertain it. For pick 45, yes Id do it. As much as I love Hunt adding another second rounder is a dream scenario for me. But only and I truly mean only, if they can find someone whos much much better than Hilliard.
fo4cr7e	1587502102	Patriots	team	Someone check on Jules
fo4cr8y	1587502102	Redskins	team	Mclaurin had the 6th highest receiving grade per PFF. As a rookie. Ahead of guys like Amari Cooper, Diggs, Keenan Allen and Tyreek Hill. Does that grade tell the whole story? No. Does his raw stats tell the whole story? Definitely not. But to say he isnt a true offensive weapon because you think he isnt is just plain wrong.
fo4crc2	1587502103	49ers	team	Speed only? Just stop
fo4crki	1587502107	Steelers	nfl	They love Bama boys.
fo4crq5	1587502109	Lions	nfl	He gets like 10 after he plays us twice.
fo4crr6	1587502109	Browns	team	Id do it for their 2nd too
fo4crap	1587502103	Redskins	team	The situations are incomparable. A player coming out of retirement with the desire to only play for one specific team has immensely less value than a player holding out for a tradenew contract
fo4crd9	1587502104	Eagles	team	Man, if we dont go WR in the first, especially if Jefferson or Ruggs are somehow there, we better draft multiple WR in the 2nd roundearly 3rd round. Possibly trade back into the 2nd to grab another, after 53. While I know LB is a need for us as well, I dont see how you cant draft RuggsJefferson IF theyre there after sitting through the awful display at wideout last season.
fo4crmk	1587502108	Saints	nfl	2620. Our secondary was awful and cost us in OT when Thielen caught a 40yd bomb from Cousins that set Rudolphs touchdown. Our defense played pretty damn well and usually stepped up when they needed to. But that game was a bad day for the whole team.
fo4crwl	1587502112	Broncos	nfl	Theres also no reason to not treat Gronk right. Pats did the right thing and got something out of it. Its a win win. No reason for anyone but fans of other AFC North or NFC south teams to be mad.
fo4cs0k	1587502113	Bears	nfl	The Bucs also have to eat the 10mil salary owed
fo4crl1	1587502107	Buccaneers	team	Dont hurt me like that.
fo4cs42	1587502115	Falcons	nfl	Sorry to say but Tepper is in it for the business investment.Dude has 11 billion and is clearly having fun waving his money around.Case in point He jumped some other proposals to buy an MLS team, and has them starting play next year at the Panthers stadium.I mean, other proposals from better ownership groups, years of investment in local soccer communities, plans in place for soccer specific stadiums, etc.He saw the goldmine Blank discovered here in Atlanta with soccer and he wants to replicate it the Carolinas, a hotbed for the sport I hear.He also knows the Panthers will be rebuilding and fans might not show up.Hence, hell market his new soccer team and make up the revenue.
fo4cs6w	1587502116	Raiders	nfl	Get fournette and its GG
fo4csbd	1587502118	Steelers	nfl	Dont forget about Leveon Bell sitting out an entire season to force his way out of town the year before AB.
fo4csce	1587502118	Saints	nfl	Im in this comment and I dont like it
fo4csev	1587502119	Lions	team	If we didnt trade for Harmon, I would be all for hooker.
fo4crx5	1587502112	Redskins	team	Not controversial, if Rivera likes Tua and thinks hes the guy then take him. Avoid controversy by trading Haskins immediately. People will hate but if Ron thinks Tua is the franchise QB who gives a fuck, people shut up about the Cardinals real quick last year when Murray played better than Rosen.
fo4crxy	1587502112	Bills	nfl	Am I the only one that thinks theyre still gonna miss the playoffs?
fo4crzt	1587502113	Buccaneers	team	This is crazy. At least with the brady thing we had two days to process it. With this Im just casually scrolling reddit and I see  GRONK has signed. Wild.
fo4cs64	1587502115	Packers	team	Ya, Im low key excited about Willis.  Hope he turns it around with us.
fo4cs7b	1587502116	Patriots	team	Jules next.....Might as well clear all players of value and get high picks if possible Gilmore, Thunney, etc
fo4csde	1587502119	Eagles	team	I think that shows more than enough questionable judgement to justify not taking the risk.
fo4cs4c	1587502115	Jets	team	Something tells me this deal is hammered out pretty quickly after the draft
fo4csct	1587502118	Vikings	team	Hes probably not even worth a 2nd.
fo4csdw	1587502119	Eagles	nfl	Lol right?  Like wtf they dont even play the same position or even the same side of the ball.  Pats fans, smh
fo4csep	1587502119	Patriots	team	Holy shit this is the dumbest take Ive seen in a long time.
fo4csgi	1587502120	Vikings	nfl	Seahawks
fo4csh4	1587502120	Ravens	nfl	I dont actually expect Brown to ever play again. His legal troubles are too big. You cant almost kill a kid by throwing shit our of a hotel window and assault an innocent person and come out looking innocent.
fo4csjm	1587502121	Packers	team	I would give up our 4th rounder for him now that tampa lost theres. I dont know if the Bucs would accept that however. thoughts?
fo4csny	1587502123	Buccaneers	nfl	Money is the issue. Cant afford what hes making now, much less what he wants to make. Howard doesnt make enough to offset that.
fo4csrk	1587502124	Patriots	team	I mean, we did trade him, but got basically nothing in return
fo4cst4	1587502125	Bears	nfl	Its probably higher than that
fo4csva	1587502126	Jets	nfl	3 way tradeNYJ gives up Adams, 3rd rd pickNYJ receives Hooker, 1st rd pick DAL gives up 1st rd, 2nd rd pickDAL receives AdamsIND gives up HookerIND receives 2nd rd pickI have no idea if all of the values add up correctly 3way trades are hard to think up
fo4csc9	1587502118	49ers	team	With KC being KC, New Orleans adding Sanders and potentially another WR in the 1st, and now Tampa adding BradyGronk to go with 2 elite WR1s, we need to make our offense more explosive if we want to compete with these other top tier offenses.

fo4csfw	1587502120	Lions	team	Yikes
fo4csrm	1587502124	Redskins	nfl	Where you live, homie?
fo4ct22	1587502128	Patriots	nfl	Im not sure which ones  we offered a second for Howard last year and were told no.
fo4csit	1587502121	49ers	nfl	In before Tampbert Baykowski
fo4csk9	1587502121	Patriots	nfl	This is somehow dumber than AB to the Pats, if only because it required less effort
fo4csn7	1587502123	Buccaneers	nfl	Were gonna be the new baddies... Either we play amazing, in which case people hate that Brady and Gronk are succeeding somewhere else and we bought our success.Or we are middling to sucky and we wasted the end of Tom Bradys career. Thats how I see this playing out.
fo4csor	1587502123	Giants	team	Im sexy at it.
fo4csp5	1587502123	Patriots	team	Wait where did I state that lol. How far back did yall go?
fo4csqq	1587502124	Patriots	team	Gronk being traded doesnt really change anything for us because he was not going to play here. Only now we moved up 3 rounds in the draft. They will likely still try to win with Stidham and if he isnt the guy they will probably sign or draft someone in 2021. They cant do much with their cap space right now.
fo4csvi	1587502126	Lions	team	Sad, we should have Ed Oliver and could have acquired OJ Howard for pennies on the dollar at any point
fo4cszn	1587502127	Patriots	team	trade rape(httpsyoutu.bejOh0t0XUYRA)
fo4csty	1587502125	Jaguars	nfl	First round. Maybe second. Actually, I think hell fall to the 6th. Never mind, undrafted.
fo4csxs	1587502127	Redskins	team	comp 4th or 5th is a good starting option. The good news for us is that we wont be impending the Buccaneers from any Super Bowl run versus trading him to the 49ers or Packers or Bears will get in the way
fo4ctg7	1587502134	Buccaneers	team	Fuck. Im a TB12 fan first and foremost but goddammit I want you guys to win a SB so incredibly badly. Go fucking Bucs baby
fo4ct43	1587502129	Vikings	nfl	Hungry. Been 5 hours since Ive eaten lunch, and its my regular dinner time.
fo4ct6e	1587502130	Patriots	nfl	Well his mom lives in Ft Myers, hes down here all time. Hes already a well seasoned Florida Man lmao
fo4ct6g	1587502130	Patriots	team	Hed come if Brady asked, Im guessing Brady wasnt willing to ask Gronk back if it made Gronk miserable  shit sucks.
fo4cted	1587502133	Giants	team	BACD
fo4ctft	1587502133	Chiefs	nfl	Fucking great year to play the NFC South...
fo4cth4	1587502134	Giants	team	This page has like 1,000 followers and were gonna believe their anonymous source????
fo4ctm2	1587502136	Patriots	team	Maybe we should trade then ty law or Troy Brown while were at it.
fo4ct0q	1587502128	Buccaneers	nfl	Gronk might be rejuvenated after a full year off of not getting hit. One can hope. Even if he only plays 50 of the snaps every game, its still a big addition at a position the Bucs already have an embarrassment of riches at.
fo4ct4c	1587502129	Giants	nfl	Yellowstone is one of the most heavily monitored volcanoes on the planet.  Yes we would have advanced warning, and being so large it would take a long time to build the pressure.  Not sure about playing god and Im no geologist.  But we have tried to purposefully weaken hurricanes in the past, and then learned the process we researched to weaken them naturally occurs and can actually restrengthen it, so we abandoned it.
fo4ct5y	1587502130	Browns	nfl	Yes please oh please PLEASE do it.
fo4ctaq	1587502132	49ers	nfl	Browns for Njoku
fo4cte6	1587502133	Patriots	team	Guess he really didnt want to play for Belichick anymore.
fo4ctun	1587502139	Lions	nfl	Jason Campbell QBd that Auburn team and he went 1.25 in the same draft. Had 3 future NFL WRs as well with Ben Obomanu, Devin Aromashodu, and Courtney Taylor. That offense was fucking loaded and got snubbed from playing USC in the title game in which OU got demolished. USCAuburn would have a great game (with USC probably winning because it was that USC team).
fo4ctvl	1587502140	Patriots	nfl	60 Catches 800 Yards and 13 TDS? Thats pretty good production
fo4ctvo	1587502140	Patriots	nfl	? 2 WR 3 TE sets are very common
fo4cthi	1587502134	Chargers	nfl	Wow, moulds had a better career than I remembered
fo4ctil	1587502135	Saints	nfl	Ok Ill give you that. Thats funny.
fo4cts7	1587502138	Saints	nfl	Jameis is also much more mobile
fo4ctv3	1587502139	Ravens	nfl	Ray Rice was not a big ego and he wasnt a off the field issue outside of the incident that got him kicked off the team before the season even started.
fo4ctwd	1587502140	Colts	nfl	No. Has to be an AFC team now for the 3li upset
fo4ctn8	1587502136	Saints	team	Hi fellow Georgians. Fuck Kemp.
fo4ctq2	1587502137	Patriots	team	no cap space
fo4cttb	1587502139	Colts	nfl	Right.... because 761  900.  Isnt that just reinforcing that the 7th is useless?
fo4ctve	1587502140	Patriots	team	Wasnt it easier for them both to play in New England?  Im depressed...
fo4ctw1	1587502140	Patriots	nfl	the Buccs OL was solid at pass blocking and Winston made the line look a whole lot worse with his happy feet. And the average brady year was with absolutely nothing around him. He easily had a bottom 5 cast.
fo4cu0a	1587502142	Bengals	team	Even Vegas(httpswww.vegasinsider.comnfloddsdraft) has the odds of the Bengals taking Burrow at 100000. Were definitely taking him
fo4cu2m	1587502142	Patriots	team	It definitely was not all a farce. Dude was in tears describing his physical state at the end of his last season. He took the time he needed, now feels well enough to come back. And of course he would want to be with Tom on a team with a real shot to win. Also this gets us something rather than nothing which is what we had with him retired. Dont understand the gronk hate at all, his legacy in NE is untouchable.
fo4ctrv	1587502138	Jets	team	Bot on Bot violence is really picking up lmao
fo4ctxj	1587502140	Ravens	nfl	I think I can speak for all the AFC team fan bases...have fun NFC.
fo4cu2l	1587502142	Patriots	team	Hes in the top 10 only because the tight end position is weak around the league. Plus, I dont expect his body to respond positively to the grind of the NFL after taking over a year off. Especially a guy like him who has taken so many big hits. Hes going to be even more frail
fo4cue2	1587502147	Browns	team	Lol cmon man at least be realistic. Hunt is not worth a first rounder at all.
fo4ctym	1587502141	Buccaneers	nfl	WTF IS OUR TEAM NOW
fo4cud2	1587502146	Packers	nfl	THIS IS WHY WE F5!!!
fo4cud7	1587502146	Buccaneers	team	(
fo4culs	1587502149	Jets	team	lets not get ahead of ourselves
fo4cuqw	1587502151	Redskins	team	Buccs already gave a long term deal on their LT last year who played solid. I dont really see them taking a LT in the draft. Trent is an upgrade but their long term LT is already on the roster
fo4cudx	1587502147	Ravens	team	Madden 05 made me a Ravens fan, Madden 21 here I come!!
fo4cuj1	1587502148	Buccaneers	team	What the frickity dickity fuck is goin on
fo4cune	1587502150	Colts	nfl	What? Has Gronlowski gone so down that hes only worth a 4th round pick? Is it to due with his contract?
fo4cuq6	1587502151	Redskins	team	Sneaky suspicion, some team already has deal in place for OJ Howard and well hear about it after Gronk is official.
fo4cuqs	1587502151	Eagles	nfl	God, I love a good cubano.
fo4curp	1587502152	Patriots	team	With a RB you can only put so many weapons on the field. Gronk and Brate on the line, Godwin and Mike Evans outside, some RB they draft lined up behind Brady. Thats 11 men. I doubt they hold onto Howard now.
fo4cudn	1587502147	49ers	team	Has everyone forgotten about RosstheBoss Dwelley? Howard was extremely disappointing last year. Hes got a year left on his rookie deal with a 5th year option that probably isnt worth picking up based on his production. I wouldnt give up much for him. Maybe a straight up trade with Goodwin but we might be better off keeping Goodwin if we dont get a speed receiver.
fo4cui3	1587502148	Bengals	nfl	depends on the mouse. logitech g pro wireless has better delay time than a lot of other gamer wired mice

fo4cukq	1587502149	Patriots	nfl	Glazer Just heard from Gronk, tune in tomorrow at 11pm for HUGE NEWS.  National, big news.  Im not kidding.
fo4cusy	1587502152	Lions	nfl	Ya gotta spit on it
fo4cuuc	1587502153	Giants	nfl	Hell be injured within a month.
fo4cuvb	1587502153	Bills	nfl	He played 13 games and got the 12 most targets of TEs in the league, and also if he played more his stats would be better isnt a good argument because not being available is a negative, full stop.
fo4cuvx	1587502153	Patriots	team	Actually youre right. I have no idea why I thought it was next years.
fo4cuz7	1587502155	49ers	nfl	Im envisioning reverse after reverse to him and Deebo. Ugh.
fo4cv6i	1587502158	Patriots	team	I love Gronk, but hes an idiot. A big, goofy, uncoverable wrecking ball of an idiot.  Look at the bright side, we get a 4th round pick for nothing and have a second team to root for when the Pats arent playing.
fo4cvj0	1587502162	Patriots	nfl	And two more rings 
fo4cvk7	1587502163	Eagles	nfl	Im interested to see how Brady influences the locker room in TB. Also how he works with Arians.
fo4cv2x	1587502156	Ravens	nfl	Rob gronkOw! My Back!ski
fo4cv6x	1587502158	Redskins	nfl	At least they arent playing that team next year
fo4cvat	1587502159	Patriots	team	Very excited to see Jarrett Stidham this year throw to great TEs likechecks notesRyan Izzo and Matt Lacosse?
fo4cvj1	1587502162	Bengals	nfl	Jules is looking in crying outside the window
fo4cvqd	1587502165	Patriots	nfl	Brady was a 6th round pick, dont get too ludicrous out here
fo4cvz2	1587502168	Patriots	team	Saw it on rnfl but its like finding a 20 bill in a jacket you havent worn in a couple winters
fo4cvkr	1587502163	Patriots	team	Exactly, we now have 13 picks in the draft and itll be interesting to see us move up and down the draft board
fo4cvl0	1587502163	Vikings	nfl	Ironically, Ive seen him get more of his due respect now that hes retired. He was straight up top three some of the years he played
fo4cvp9	1587502164	Patriots	team	Brother, if this is the worst day of your life, I fucking envy the shit out of you.
fo4cvql	1587502165	Buccaneers	team	Did not take any Gronk to the Bucs rumors seriously. This definitely spells the end of OJ Howard, since Gronk is now eating 10 million of our salary cap we need to create some extra space to sign rookies.
fo4cvyx	1587502168	Buccaneers	team	Well we played each other in 1819 so I think it will be at least 2122 before we play again, outside of a Superbowl.Imagine if you will, snow blowing across the field of Foxboro, lights shining bright on a chilly Sunday night in December. Brady stands at the 25 in what could be his last NFL regular season game. He drops back scanning the field and throws a spiral deep corner of the endzone, Gronkowski vaults into the air pulling down the game winning touchdown in the dying seconds.You hear over the PA system Buccaneers Win!
fo4cvky	1587502163	Packers	team	Still need ILB and a corner, but an offensive draft would be exciting.
fo4cvpv	1587502165	Patriots	team	Did they need a 30 year old TE? I mean I could see it happening. Brady is Edelmans man crush. Hell be asking for a trade, I bet.
fo4cvv3	1587502166	Redskins	team	Id offer out comp 4th in a heartbeat and if that Dosent get it done Id give up our early 4th. It would allow us not to worry much about addressing TE in a poor draft for that position.
fo4cvxh	1587502167	Browns	nfl	LMAO
fo4cw1u	1587502169	Buccaneers	team	Theyre allowed to comment, were allowed to not take them seriously though
fo4cw41	1587502170	Packers	team	All draft picks are gambles, but yeah, Gary certainly wasnt the safest pick by any stretch. Still, Gary was a high level run defender and edge setter in college, which gives him a builtin floor that I dont see for Shenault. A strong against the run, occasionally solid pass rusher isnt what youre looking for at 12th overall, but at the very least, thats a rosterable player for years to come. When I think about Shenaults worst case scenario, I see much worse than that.
fo4cw67	1587502170	Patriots	team	Alright thats where I draw the line!
fo4cvtp	1587502166	Patriots	team	Couldve used Gronk last season when Brady was throwing to nobody. 2020 just keeps getting worse

fo4cw6a	1587502170	Browns	team	Maybe we could get lucky and TB would offer a pick swap for Hunt  41 for 14 but thats a big stretch

fo4cwg5	1587502174	Patriots	team	No
fo4cwm7	1587502177	Vikings	nfl	This is unbelievable, you guys are all confirming my opinion. Throughout this thread ppl have been disagreeing with me, thinking I have a shit take, but hardly anyone gives a specific reason why. The truth is, you guys blindly followed the media spin, and started hating on bob.
fo4cw4g	1587502170	Giants	team	Lmao you cant say BREAKING when youre just sharing another rumor

fo4cwdo	1587502173	Buccaneers	nfl	How come saints fans are the only ones that are saying these facts in this thread? Theres no way of knowing whos washed until the season starts. Hell, even Brees played bad at the end of last season
fo4cwj2	1587502175	Buccaneers	nfl	Andddd hes back and a Buccaneer. Woot!
fo4cwsi	1587502179	Patriots	team	I think its just going to suck watching Brady and Gronk on the Bucs.
fo4cwnv	1587502177	Raiders	nfl	Never mind the 11 million cap hit they take for David Johnson in 2020, right? With no guarantee he will ever return to form.
fo4cwt4	1587502179	Patriots	team	On mobile it shows up pretty quickly under posts lol.

fo4cx1d	1587502182	Bills	nfl	Its really not, because again, all the stats show hes borderline top 10 at best
fo4cx47	1587502183	Patriots	nfl	I dont think this is quite how drafting works.
fo4cx4u	1587502184	Patriots	team	Plus Gronk wouldnt have come back for anything else
fo4cx6z	1587502184	49ers	team	Wouldnt be a bad replacement for Goodwin if FO trades him.
fo4cwmx	1587502177	Colts	team	Almost like he got it right off barstool
fo4cwut	1587502180	Bears	team	True. But Id rather invest in good talent that fell from the first rather than a backup QB that early.If we traded back, he fell, and if Nagy loves him, wouldnt hate taking him in the third if we had a good draft everywhere else.
fo4cwy5	1587502181	Packers	nfl	This didnt help httpstwitter.commathbombstatus1125181219795349506?s21And only one year where he played a full season which was his 5th year out of highschool
fo4cx16	1587502182	Patriots	nfl	Take care of our babies!Idk what your Oline is like, but yall are shaping up to have a scary offense. Only thing that could screw it up is no training camp.
fo4cx5i	1587502184	Packers	nfl	Theyre not going to trade a TE for a TE when they just traded for a TE and want to get rid of one of the TEs.
fo4cx68	1587502184	Jets	nfl	i dont think both herbert and tua are locks to go before 13. 1 of the 2 yes but not sure if LA decides to roll the dice with Tyrod and maybe cam and just draft a tackle since they moved on from there starting LT this offseason. But yeah i think one of the possible 7 players you mentioned might be there at 13. I just think itll likely be a WR.
fo4cx6c	1587502184	Broncos	team	Im all aboard the Ruggs hype train. Choo Choo, motherfkers 
fo4cx8m	1587502185	Patriots	team	LOL, Brady was a massive part of creating the NE system, if you think tampa is going to be anything less than a top 5 team with the goat QB and the goat TE setting the culture, youll really hate this season.
fo4cxls	1587502190	Browns	nfl	If Jordan didnt have Krause could he still lead his team to Six Finals? If Krause didnt have Jordan would he still have been able to make competitive teams and win multiple championships? I guess they both compliment each other. Its like Brady and Belichick, Im sure they would have success separately but together they created their best outcome.
fo4cx98	1587502185	Packers	nfl	I just looked up 4 different lists and it had 4 different 1 CBs of all time.  Only 1 was Deion.  The other 3 were Willie Brown, Mel Blount, and Rod Woodson.  So no, I wouldnt say it was regularly accepted.
fo4cxc9	1587502187	Patriots	team	Fuck it, give me a 3rd for Edelman and a 1st for Gilly. Lets really start over.
fo4cxft	1587502188	Falcons	nfl	Nuh uh what about the Pro Bowl
fo4cxfv	1587502188	49ers	nfl	Plus the NFL would love Gronk and Brady reuniting. Even if they were still testing for weed, no way they let that derail this hype train.
fo4cxg5	1587502188	Panthers	team	Hurney usually lands the first round picks well. But everything else is abysmal with only RARE exceptions. While his tenure as GM 2.0 has been better, I fear he is already falling into his old habits and we will suffer in the draft too.
fo4cxjn	1587502190	Patriots	team	It isnt on paper. Still gets me in the feels. I probably would have told him to go fucking wrestle but youre right you are getting some value for no value
fo4cxko	1587502190	Jaguars	nfl	The intro to Bump N Grind is insane
fo4cxln	1587502190	Falcons	team	Saints are still the most likely to win it.Bucs are going all in on TB12, which will either work great or blow up in their face.
fo4cxp6	1587502192	Patriots	team	Elderly New Englanders live out the rest of their days in Florida all the time.
fo4cxqx	1587502192	Broncos	nfl	What ramifications does this have for the Pats on draft day? This has to be Pats moving up for someone.
fo4cxtc	1587502193	Buccaneers	nfl	That Dream Team always felt forced because they didnt really have a QB you could count on. They were depending on post 30 year old Michael Vick and most of their dream team components were receivers lol.
fo4cxyj	1587502195	Patriots	nfl	Patriots had 0 leverage because if Gronk unretires then hes owes more money on the cap thats the Patriots dont have.
fo4cxfk	1587502188	Patriots	team	Lmao, the nfl notorious for paying premiums on past performances riddled with injuries.
fo4cxgb	1587502188	Texans	nfl	Its interesting hearing retired players talk about that. A couple I listen to on the radio play with the idea because they get so bruised and postpone so many minor surgeries and health issues every off season. A season off to clean up scar tissue or heal might give him a better year the following year.
fo4cxg9	1587502188	Giants	team	Picked Wills
fo4cxld	1587502190	Patriots	nfl	I would much rather it be the Pats but BradyGronk Superbowl would be pretty sweet
fo4cxng	1587502191	Patriots	team	Pats won that deal
fo4cxp0	1587502191	49ers	nfl	Spanos and Kroenke might be the worst NFL owners, but Snyder is the worst human being who happens to own an NFL team. Hes a disgusting human being, Kroenke and Spanos are just hated for relocating teams and other smaller questionable moves. As a neutral fan, Id take either of them over some guy who pimps out his cheerleaders in a foreign country while taking their passports.
fo4cxpb	1587502192	Falcons	team	Or the BIG DICK pick six before that!
fo4cxsp	1587502193	Chargers	team	I hope Pat McAfee is correct that they are hiding an all powderblue color rush, that would be 100 insane
fo4cxta	1587502193	Giants	nfl	Eli the White(r)?
fo4cxv4	1587502194	Falcons	team	Somebody see what Jesse Tuggle is up to.
fo4cy3v	1587502197	Redskins	team	I hate multiple team trades (
fo4cy9j	1587502199	Patriots	team	Free Julian Edelman
fo4cyau	1587502200	Seahawks	nfl	removed
fo4cy1c	1587502196	Cardinals	nfl	Wait no, thats illegal!Also I thought Gronk retired, why do the Pats still have rights to his contract?
fo4cy42	1587502197	Patriots	nfl	The pats could have just said no to the trade, or traded him to any other team in the league and gotten anything they want with the condition that gronk reports for playing first.They didnt have to take anything from Tampa because theres no negative outcome for the pats there. Gronk isnt hurting our cap.
fo4cyfy	1587502202	Chiefs	nfl	It and crying jordan are 2 sports memes that will live on forever
fo4cy1z	1587502196	Broncos	nfl	If Gronk and Brady do not win in Tampa, does it not mean Belichick is the goat?
fo4cy2e	1587502197	Seahawks	nfl	This is your fault
fo4cy7c	1587502199	Panthers	team	He just got it. 2020 season officially over, lads.
fo4cydi	1587502201	Bears	nfl	And Gronk has been out of the league a year, gets hurt every year he plays, and is owed 10mil
fo4cynv	1587502205	Steelers	nfl	Maybe, just maybe, there was some truth in that wickersham article.inb4 this commented is buried by Pats fans
fo4cys9	1587502207	Vikings	nfl	We need this season to be played!!!
fo4cysj	1587502207	Giants	nfl	T
fo4cyhm	1587502203	Dolphins	team	How about take no qb!
fo4cyp0	1587502206	Browns	nfl	Brady then rips off his jersey to reveal he is the third man.
fo4cyp8	1587502206	Seahawks	nfl	Youre just plain stupid. Waste of time conversation.
fo4cyo4	1587502205	Patriots	team	Gronk is retired and signed a deal with WWE...doubt he will come back to the NFL.
fo4cys4	1587502207	Buccaneers	team	Lol Im actually a former Patsfirst fan...Its BradyGronk first now, Pats second D
fo4cysf	1587502207	Patriots	team	Hey come on man, put some respect on (checks TE depth chart)...nevermind.
fo4cyvc	1587502208	Patriots	nfl	We just replayed clips of him dragging Redskins players into the endzone and demanded a first.
fo4cz0i	1587502210	Patriots	nfl	How did we not get ducking Brate out of this, Id rather him than the 4th... right?
fo4czal	1587502214	Patriots	nfl	Made Michel not look like a bust lol
fo4czbi	1587502214	Colts	nfl	Do you understand why itd be easier for you to brush it off and think of it as nothing as opposed to other people? Black players kneelOwner says cant have inmates running the prison No where at all, you dont see how that could hit someone? What race are you?
fo4czcm	1587502215	Patriots	team	If he came out of retirement and we put him on the trade block instead of him dictating the trade I am sure he wouldve had multiple suitors for at least a 3rd or more.
fo4cyxh	1587502209	Seahawks	team	I knew we could find common ground!
fo4cz4p	1587502212	Patriots	nfl	I mean neither is Michel but he gashed the Chargers and Chiefs in the playoffs
fo4cz7a	1587502213	Patriots	nfl	Plot Twist  BB will soon transfer to TB, relieving Arians.
fo4czkn	1587502218	Broncos	nfl	If he retired last year, how is he still with the Patriotshow can the Patriots trade him? That makes no sense?
fo4cztb	1587502221	Chargers	team	Lie Down,Try not to buy all of them,Buy all of them.
fo4czqm	1587502220	Vikings	team	We have 1 WR. And for the most part offensive line options are not going to be great at our pick. We will most likely be able to get a guy on the same level in round twoWhile if a ruggs, judy, Jefferson falls.Those are clearly better players.You take them
fo4czvk	1587502222	Patriots	nfl	He was a real killer out there.
fo4czvv	1587502222	Eagles	nfl	But what will happen to the 247 title
fo4czys	1587502223	Chargers	nfl	WR wasnt really a significant need in that draft. Not compared to say, Oline or a safety
fo4d03x	1587502225	Ravens	nfl	If anyone thinks otherwise theyre insane
fo4czgy	1587502217	Giants	team	That receiving Corp is scary af
fo4czja	1587502217	Patriots	team	Incorrect
fo4czkg	1587502218	Patriots	team	Ewwww
fo4cznl	1587502219	Patriots	nfl	Im surprised Gronk was there for 9 seasons or whatever. He seemed like the antiBelichick.
fo4czoi	1587502219	Eagles	nfl	Is OJ Howard trade bait or could they run a two TE set like Brady is used to in NE?
fo4czol	1587502219	Panthers	team	Right but thats not explaining why you think hes not as highly rated as most pundits do, as the majority of them still see him as a top 1520 player in the draft. Im more looking for what you see in his grade and under your own evaluation that has him falling as opposed to just about every reputable site under the son saying hes going in round 1. I think the absolute lowest Ive seen him on a big board is 22, so again, Im not trying to put you on blast, it just looks like youve done some analysis on the guy but Im looking for why you think he slips.
fo4czor	1587502220	Packers	nfl	Yeah this seems kinda weird. Also why not let him inside the house for the draft and then have him sleep in the winnebago? Lol
fo4cztn	1587502221	Patriots	team	Weve already seen what he can do? Why are you salty about this lol Arians is one of the better coaches in the league
fo4czwm	1587502222	Patriots	team	Haha yea I lived in Mass for 3 years I know how Pats fans are.
fo4czwf	1587502222	Giants	team	I highly doubt Murray will still be there, but ill be ecstatic if he is
fo4d07x	1587502227	Ravens	nfl	I will. Ill give credit where its due. Bill Belichick could easily be called the greatest coach in nfl history. He didnt need tom to succeed. Hes proven that when tom was on the bench and his team was still number 1 in their division.  But yes, I think after 20 years were all ready for the Patriots to die as a successful organization
fo4d080	1587502227	Redskins	nfl	Hmm, idk remember when he had AB and Josh Gordon on his team?
fo4d0bu	1587502228	Bears	team	Its important to see what he does against the best teams for sure. He probably spent a lot of game time up big against inferior opponents. Compare this to Deshaun Watson, who still put up good numbers against Alabama
fo4d0co	1587502229	Bills	nfl	Hes got enough to worry about. Isnt he getting sued by andrew lucks dad
fo4d0ep	1587502229	Steelers	nfl	Is this hot, I mean didnt he get like wayyy lighter
fo4d007	1587502224	Cowboys	nfl	I understand that but bro were in completely uncharted waters. I just do not understand where the confidence comes from
fo4d01g	1587502224	Redskins	nfl	They traded a 4th and got a 7th  Gronk. Its gonna be a damn interesting year.
fo4d03g	1587502225	Colts	team	At this point the Bucs would probably take one of our 6th round picks. They lost all leverage in trading by signing Gronk. I would love Howard for a 6th, those picks are mostly lotto picks.
fo4d092	1587502227	Lions	nfl	Ive heard rumors that he has been consulting with Kelvin Benjamin.
fo4d0ds	1587502229	Panthers	team	Gib OJ Howard
fo4d07i	1587502227	Patriots	team	Have a nice day Butthead9181
fo4d08e	1587502227	Raiders	team	This is awesome thank you! Responses here have been amazing!
fo4d0c3	1587502228	Bills	nfl	Stop talking to mirrors, thats creepy
fo4d0e2	1587502229	Chargers	team	counter point  HR cant come to my house.
fo4d0ia	1587502231	Ravens	nfl	I know youre joking but this was most of the season we watched in Baltimore
fo4d0ik	1587502231	Seahawks	nfl	Yeah they got two elite receivers and nothing else out wide right now. Three good TEs, all of whom are good blockers who can help their rookie RT let them basically sit in max protection 12 personnel all day while still having EvansGodwinone TE running routes at all times against defenses that HAVE to play base unless they want Gronk driving a corner 20 yards downfield. I love that idea. But theyll need 3 guys to make it possible
fo4d0d7	1587502229	Patriots	team	Gronk had NE by the balls. He could of forced a release considering theres money owed on the contract and we are fucked in cap space if he played for us.
fo4d0hb	1587502231	Vikings	team	This was the informative piece I needed going into the draft.
fo4d0uw	1587502236	Ravens	nfl	The Ravens were literally the worst rushing attack in the NFL when Lamar took over in 2018 (week 11). Since then theyve averaged like 230 rushing yards per game.The only reason you hear about the Ravens recordbreaking rushing offense is because Lamar is arguably the best running QB of all time.
fo4d0vf	1587502236	49ers	team	Lynn Bowden
fo4d0vx	1587502236	Bears	team	I dont think Bruce Arians would accept a trade for another TE, his system barely uses them as is.
fo4d0y4	1587502237	Cowboys	nfl	Tampa Bay did more in attempting to become the Patriots in one offseason than BoB and Patricia tried to during their tenures.Its because, Bill oBrian is a hack.
fo4d0gr	1587502230	Bills	nfl	Wait what
fo4d0xk	1587502237	49ers	team	If you think Ruggs is speed only, then you definitely never really watched him play and only saw he 40 time.
fo4d164	1587502240	Patriots	nfl	Id be more convinced if there were any indication of what the Pats were doing with the cap space.
fo4d17e	1587502241	Patriots	nfl	I dont get the downvotes, youre right. Edelman has a crush on Brady only rivaled by people who worship Kpop stars and anime girls.    I mean I think he loves NE and the Pats, but Brady is his personal Jesus.
fo4d0rz	1587502234	Dolphins	nfl	I see what you did there.
fo4d0t2	1587502235	Packers	nfl	Damn here I really thought Brady would turn OJ into the next Gronk, not Gronk into the old Gronk
fo4d0u7	1587502235	Packers	team	In Sternberger We Trust
fo4d0uk	1587502236	Chiefs	team	Yeah, again, a fairytale scenario. But I consider giving up (2) 4ths and next years 1st to move into the first round of this draft a huge win. Im surprised the computer accepted, they gave it a 40 chance of approval. We may be seeing different information, but Queen is rated considerably above the 2nd RD LBs on nearly every board Ive reviewed, hence the move up. Its all in fun, thanks for the input.
fo4d0vz	1587502236	Patriots	nfl	I dont see the Patriots having an ounce of leverage here tbh. You dont trade him, he stays retired. The Bucs offer you a bag of potato chips for him and you have to take it because at least youre getting something back. Either way hes not playing for the Patriots
fo4d108	1587502238	Saints	team	Too bad Luke retired. Wouldve been nice for Gronk to be welcomed into the NFC South by Demario, Neal, Jones, and Kuechly 6 times per year.
fo4d13l	1587502239	Titans	nfl	Says the guy whose team shelled out giant money to a RB the coach didnt even want. At least the Dolphins have a plan right now and the future is looking kind of good for the Dolphins. Meanwhile the Jets have Adam Gase, the guy Ryan Tannehill left and all of a sudden became a top 58 QB. Your future as a fan is fucked.
fo4d16f	1587502240	Broncos	team	Now we just have to hope fans can actually be there in person to see it 
fo4d1a8	1587502242	49ers	nfl	Yes daddy whisper it into my ear
fo4d1ba	1587502242	Raiders	nfl	Hey put some respect on Martavius why the fuck did we spend a 3rd on this guy Bryant
fo4d1fm	1587502244	Buccaneers	team	We just got one of the best TEs to have ever played the game. Out of seemingly nowhere. Nothing like this will ever happen again to the Buccaneers. Crazy times, appreciate it.
fo4d0wn	1587502236	Patriots	team	They didnt NEED him but they got him for a steal because of circumstances. Theres no way they pay Edelmans actual value
fo4d0yv	1587502237	Patriots	team	Did you go to Rutgers?
fo4d13b	1587502239	Patriots	nfl	Brady maybe, Gronk unlikely though given hes going to have to fight for targets with Evans, Godwin etc
fo4d136	1587502239	Patriots	nfl	Gronk from the top rope and Hernandez from Davy Jones Locker
fo4d15b	1587502240	Lions	team	3 traded for 5 and dolphins 2nd round pick, brown at 5
fo4d1dv	1587502243	Patriots	team	God, I hate idiot homers like this fucker, like how can someone look at this current pats roster and think theyll even come close to sniffing the Super Bowl
fo4d1fa	1587502244	Patriots	team	Is it too much to ask for that? I literally thought wed be a happy family forever until Bradys retirement. Then he leaves. Then we gut the defense. Then this. Like every time the pats are in need this season regarding football (god bless Kraft and the masks) Im just feeling shittier and shittier
fo4d1bt	1587502242	Patriots	team	Considering the defense was constantly on the field due to Jameis turnovers, I would say they are a solid group. Secondary is definitely average but it got better during the second half of the year and their run D is considered the best in the game. Having a QB that doesnt turn the ball over as much wont have them worn out on the field, so Im sure theyll have better stats.
fo4d1dh	1587502243	Dolphins	nfl	Damn those are almost perfect, I kind of want to see those with a yellow face mask though to match the bolt outlines
fo4d1wa	1587502250	Colts	team	Its 420 all month long.Dont kill my high.
fo4d1i2	1587502245	Saints	team	Nice
fo4d1ia	1587502245	Bills	team	I think Id prefer a tackle as depth, but I cant hate this
fo4d1if	1587502245	Patriots	nfl	Nah Brate mate
fo4d1kw	1587502246	Patriots	team	Yeah hes a big part owner of a CBD business I forgot about that
fo4d1nl	1587502247	Patriots	nfl	And I guess you are forgetting who he was throwing to last year.
fo4d1sl	1587502249	Packers	nfl	Lit
fo4d1xj	1587502251	Rams	nfl	Gronk chose Brady over Mojo Rawley.
fo4d1z5	1587502251	49ers	team	Yes. I know, everybody its a Draft expert in these days, but we will see. If hes that spectacular playmaker, why he was the 3rd4th option on that alabama Offense?.
fo4d1nh	1587502247	49ers	nfl	at least we dont play Tampa next year lol
fo4d1sv	1587502249	Patriots	nfl	Im honestly kinda nervous. Not anything trade related or the Pats having no BradyGronk, but when he retired, didnt Rob say hed had like 10 concussions? His body was already breaking down a bit, and with that much damage... it seems legit scary that a dude with all that happening to him is gonna get back out on that field.
fo4d1t6	1587502249	49ers	nfl	 and being unable to sell any PSLs in the stadium that youre rentingThats ultimately not his problem. 100 of the revenue from Chargers PSLs was going to the Rams to help pay for the stadium. By not selling PSLs he just shafted Kroenke. This isnt a popular opinion on this sub, but from a business perspective Spanos got a sweetheart deal. He is responsible for 0 in stadium construction, pays 1 a year to lease the facility, and is entitled to a percentage of revenue. Its zero risk, he could move the team later to somewhere else without losing money he invested in this project, and a lot of reward in that hes entitled to some stadium revenue in the 2nd largest US Market.
fo4d23t	1587502253	Redskins	team	Ok let me know when we get more than a 3rd for Trent.
fo4d2d9	1587502257	Falcons	team	Okudah only
fo4d2ho	1587502259	Cardinals	team	I dont get why he didnt come to us. He would have a lot of fun with our GM.
fo4d2is	1587502259	Cowboys	nfl	I would love it but its not happening.What a great player. I dont see why they would ever trade him.
fo4d26z	1587502254	Packers	team	I called my female horse in RDR2 Lambeau, she was a real beaut!Youre welcome
fo4d2ci	1587502257	Vikings	team	Dalvin has proven to be special at NFL level, we are lucky enough to have gone from Peterson to Cook...we love shitting on packers fans for not squeezing enough success out of Favre then Rodgers but dont realize we have a similar predicament albeit at a less important but still crucial position especially considering zimmers style of play
fo4d2dh	1587502257	Patriots	nfl	That 2007 was still fucking dope and 2007 Brady will always be better than 2020 Brady.
fo4d2te	1587502263	Colts	nfl	They gave him 1500 touches in 56 games. They broke him.
fo4d276	1587502254	Buccaneers	team	LmaoBy far the craziest NFL offseason that Ive been alive for.
fo4d2c1	1587502257	Buccaneers	nfl	Honestly for how shit we were in the run game (actually the fucking worst, by a mile if Im correct), we were surprisingly decent with pass protection in Arians longdeveloping play scheme. Tom throws the ball quicker than most anyone, and with the threat of Tom fucking Brady every play our run game might open up a little bit. Well probably grab a lineman in the first, but Im not uncomfortable with our line asis.
fo4d2q4	1587502262	Saints	nfl	Bazinga!
fo4d2qa	1587502262	Browns	team	Why not just throw in Njoku? Washington sends us Williams, they get Njoku. Hunt to TB, TB sends us Howard. Winners all around.
fo4d2r7	1587502262	Buccaneers	nfl	lol you go get burned by OJ Howard but at this point its pretty obvious that hes almost all potential and no production.Id love to be wrong. But hes hurt me way too many times in fantasy the past several years.
fo4d2t4	1587502263	Colts	nfl	Waiting for the draft to pull the ol switcheroo.
fo4d2uo	1587502263	Raiders	team	Hilarious
fo4d33s	1587502267	Patriots	team	Hey you too buddy
fo4d38g	1587502269	Lions	nfl	Oh I agree. I just also agree he wouldnt put up with that now.
fo4d3dc	1587502271	Patriots	nfl	Dude has had like 4 back surgeries. He was obviously always in football shape but he has to have the back and knees of a 75 year old baseball catcher.
fo4d3eq	1587502271	Jets	team	Good dad. Started the hatred for all things DucksKingsPatriots early with my boys. I randomly picked the Jets to root for as a kid (loved planes and underdogshitty teams) but my wife is a born Jets fan from NJ, so it worked out.
fo4d2sx	1587502263	Saints	nfl	I believe I can fly has to be one of the best ten hip hop songs ever, that song is my childhood
fo4d2ux	1587502264	Giants	team	i just copied what the tweet said
fo4d2w3	1587502264	Falcons	nfl	I wouldve thought the patriots would try to make a play for OJ in this deal
fo4d2yo	1587502265	Cowboys	team	We had 2 1000 yard receivers. We can get a capable slot receiver in round 3 or 4 with this loaded draft class. We have too many holes to make our first round pick a luxury pick.
fo4d336	1587502267	Patriots	team	Fair enough 
fo4d35i	1587502268	Patriots	team	Who cares? Seriously after all these years you havent figures out the whole no frills mindset of this organization. Do you really want our organization to be like the Chargers? Why do people care about these stupid things?
fo4d3c5	1587502270	Colts	nfl	Based on reading the horrid story about his leg getting drained combined with the beating his body had taken Id agree with that. Will be interesting to see how he does or if he can hold up. Think he lost weight.
fo4d3eo	1587502271	Patriots	team	Lmao Im sure both will lose sleep my dude, grow up
fo4d3ex	1587502271	Buccaneers	team	We just extended Brate last year so Im not sure whod trade for his contract.
fo4d3it	1587502273	Buccaneers	team	Thats great lol
fo4d30h	1587502265	Ravens	nfl	Also could be hes been away from the game for a lil bit and his history of injuries. But still, damn.
fo4d3gn	1587502272	Raiders	nfl	Yes. Yes? Yes. I think.
fo4d3bq	1587502270	49ers	nfl	what the hell
fo4d3wv	1587502279	Patriots	team	Except we gave them a 7th too
fo4d3gh	1587502272	Jets	nfl	Take it easy Abed, the point is you had them and lost them and now we get to watch.
fo4d3k4	1587502273	Patriots	team	Who are the major contributors from the draft in the past 7 years? Most of these guys arent even on the team.  Most of our major contributors have been free agents.
fo4d3na	1587502275	Raiders	nfl	Cover athlete is the normal term I think
fo4d3p8	1587502276	Bears	team	it doesnt always correlate, but it sure helps to have a guy that can take the top off.  Especially when your main running back is also one of the slowest in the league.  No speed at TE either.  The only fast guy is a 52 120lb guy.  There are only a couple guys who might be worth taking that high so odds are not likely it will happen.  But it would be good for the Bears
fo4d3sr	1587502277	Lions	team	
fo4d3v3	1587502278	Patriots	nfl	Sure.  Theyre sending him exactly where he wants to go.  But people acting as if the Bucs have them by the balls here are crazy.  The Patriots literally didnt have to do a thing.  If they dont like what the Bucs offer they can just say no and Gronk stays retired.  They know he only wants to play with Brady.  People here dont understand negotiations.
fo4d3wd	1587502278	49ers	nfl	Ill take a quarter of that just for self
fo4d3xg	1587502279	Seahawks	nfl	For what its worth, thats on the NFL, not MaddenEA Sports.
fo4d3zc	1587502279	49ers	nfl	5 yards off of 10,000 has gotta hurt. Thats just a few slightly more favorable spots from the line judge over a long career.
fo4d42m	1587502281	Redskins	nfl	 And there is 0 indication so far that the season will be cancelled, baseball was supposed to start a month ago and they are still not cancelling it.It aint happening unless a vaccine is done, and there wont be one this year.
fo4d46w	1587502282	Cowboys	nfl	Not if the upside is top 5 production. Worth a shot if the players cheap.
fo4d48h	1587502283	Bears	nfl	I just dont see how hes worth the 10 mil. I think people are vastly overrating how good a 43 year old Brady and one year post retirement Gronk are gonna be
fo4d3n9	1587502275	49ers	team	Chase Young is a monster but our 13 and 31 wouldnt even be enough. I do think he is best Ive seen though, he has the numbers, tape, and tools. No question marks with the man.
fo4d3q1	1587502276	Jaguars	nfl	Luck to the Patriots
fo4d3v9	1587502278	Patriots	team	Hell only come on the field for 3rd downs in close games or in the red zone.
fo4d41z	1587502280	Buccaneers	team	Brate restructured his contract to stay another year so unlikely hell be traded, also I prefer brate over OJ as a second choice to gronk
fo4d438	1587502281	Bears	nfl	Ah. Now I see it. Thanks!
fo4d455	1587502282	Ravens	nfl	So let him stay retired, its not the patriots wanting to have gronk play with brady its brady and gronk wanting to play in Tampa. I would sit on it until Tampa presented a better deal and they would if they wanted to keep their shiny new qb happy
fo4d45p	1587502282	Seahawks	nfl	Smothered and covered baby.
fo4d46t	1587502282	Patriots	team	Thuney gonna be gone this week too. Im really hurting rn.
fo4d4ff	1587502286	Patriots	team	Im pretty sure that he said that he does not want to be traded and is happy here a few weeks ago
fo4d3yh	1587502279	49ers	nfl	I mean Mike Brown is just a cheapskate right? Has he done anything other than seemingly not caring about winning to take the crown from a Snyder, Spanos, or Kroenke?
fo4d46c	1587502282	Patriots	team	Fuck off
fo4d4bt	1587502284	Panthers	nfl	First time?
fo4d4h6	1587502286	Patriots	nfl	Not many have said this but I think the Chiefs among the benefactors of Tom Brady joining the Bucs.

fo4d4dg	1587502285	Seahawks	nfl	After briefly looking at your profile I have determined that you have no place calling anything cringey. Patriots fan that posts in rcoronavirus, rpolitics, and rwallstreetbets. Youre probably either 13 or 26 living in your moms basement where every surface is covered in dried cum andor off brand dorito dust and your walls are plastered with Tom Brady and Mark Wahlberg posters.
fo4d4ds	1587502285	Falcons	nfl	They traded a 4th rounder for a dude who probably was not worth a 4th the last time he played, and now hes spent an entire year off
fo4d4dr	1587502285	Eagles	nfl	OJ Howard and Cameron Brate (if they both are around) are solid backup plans if Gronk is a shell

fo4d4kj	1587502288	Giants	team	It seems like every team redesigns and the fans hate it and they end up redesigning again to a throwback uniform. Bucs and Browns did that, and the chargers just went straight to the throwbacks which look pretty good. If they do something along the lines of their color rush jersey I would be pretty happy.

fo4d5jn	1587502301	Patriots	team	Bullshit. He wants to be with Brady, not Stidham

fo4d6at	1587502312	Saints	team	Not worried a single bit. Its not like Brady and Gronk gonna carry the whole team to victory. Buccs still have a lot of flaws.

fo4d65w	1587502310	Patriots	team	So he beat you to saying ugh you beat me to this meme?
fo4d66b	1587502310	Patriots	team	because they know that if the Patriot way had even a slight bend of respect for the greatest, both Brady and Gronk would have suited up again for a final run and retired Pats, maybe even with another ring, but now they are going to have a real shot at it elsewhere.
fo4d6cu	1587502312	Buccaneers	team	When youre a type of guy that goes head hunting on a punt returner, apparently so.
fo4d6go	1587502314	Ravens	nfl	I dont think he wants to come back.
fo4d6gw	1587502314	Patriots	nfl	That was exactly what I was suggesting  Theres no argument of, well, they had to give up a seventh rounder for their fourth.  Gronk was worth nothing to New England, because he wasnt going to play.  So if we can give him and a 7th for the difference between 20 and 23, make that trade.
fo4d6hr	1587502314	Colts	nfl	For Jalen Roses sake I hope you do.
fo4d6km	1587502315	Redskins	team	LOL, sorry to mislead...I think its a separate trade that kicks off after.

fo4d6z2	1587502321	Buccaneers	team	Pats fan here. It will be interesting to see how Gronk does. He hasnt played for a reason and the last one he did he looked washed up. Possibly injury related.Could be an amazing pickup could not. He aint a sure thing anymore.

fo4d6tr	1587502319	Patriots	team	The Pats couldnt afford Gronk the moment he unretired, so its impressive that we actually got something in return.
fo4d73m	1587502322	Jets	team	chargers too, they traded their starting tackle to carolina for trai turner (guard).
fo4d75u	1587502323	Buccaneers	nfl	Deion didnt play zone though. He covered one half of the field in man coverage.

fo4d6yo	1587502321	Jets	nfl	Youre not OP and nobody was thinking of you...
fo4d7a8	1587502325	Patriots	team	Yes.
fo4d7bh	1587502326	Colts	nfl	Given that TB has been shopping OJ for weeks and still havent been able to strike a deal shows that teams arent that high on him as you may think. Plus teams know the current situationrelationship with the Bucs and OJ, so thats even more leverage they have over TB.
fo4d7g9	1587502327	Patriots	nfl	That would be a winnow move and were not in a position to make those

fo4d7fk	1587502327	Redskins	nfl	My guess is this implies that Arizona approached him about a contract vs the other way aroundthreat of a holdout. I get what you mean though.
fo4d7kh	1587502329	Patriots	team	Im ill right now just thinking about it.

fo4d7ze	1587502335	Bills	nfl	Wow, that wasnt a joke
fo4d85f	1587502337	Packers	team	I would agree. I think hes got all the tools, just doesnt know how to use them yet. Im still open to keeping him around for now, but Im lookin at him like I looked at Gmo if he turns out, awesome, but if he doesnt, not a shocker
fo4d800	1587502335	Patriots	nfl	Hernandez thought the same thing.
fo4d88p	1587502338	Chargers	team	They did a nice touch with the helmet match the color but I think they could have made this way better
fo4d8ai	1587502339	Patriots	team	Because Im done with this sports for my health and the well being of my future feels a lot better than Id rather be retired than play with your team and as soon as Brady goes to another team Im gonna jet over there because fuck the Patriots.
fo4d8cc	1587502339	Colts	nfl	Eli to the Chargers?
fo4d7sz	1587502332	Dolphins	team	same
fo4d7y4	1587502334	Patriots	nfl	I think its super fucking obvious that Brady has some influence in this.
fo4d8bb	1587502339	Buccaneers	team	Can comp picks even be traded? I think it is 107
fo4d8jb	1587502342	Patriots	team	Im fine remaining on the Pats duck boat thanks.
fo4d7y3	1587502334	Bears	team	Yeah he struggled to read defenses and anticipate his WRs breaking open. Sound familiar?
fo4d80j	1587502335	Cowboys	nfl	I dont think you can count on that many TDs, but if he got TB 60 for 800, I dont think anyone there is mad at that.
fo4d8b6	1587502339	Patriots	team	Without Parcells Kraft never trades for Belichick and your dynasty never happens.
fo4d8dj	1587502340	Patriots	nfl	Oh go buy another super bowl you salty fuck.
fo4d8ew	1587502340	Patriots	nfl	But having great receiving options takes pressure of the line. Thats why keeping AB would have been so huge for us this past year. Double coverage means one less passrusher.
fo4d8fi	1587502341	Bears	nfl	Fans overestimate player value in 100 of trades.  Fans never consider the contract which is where all the value or lack thereof lies.

fo4d8q5	1587502344	Seahawks	nfl	NOT THAT MUCH HONEST
fo4d8ri	1587502345	Browns	team	Most RBs arent but the exact type of RB Tom Brady wants on a cheap deal that is proven are not exactly common. They are in GM Lebron win now mode to the extreme. Gotta overpay.

fo4d9cn	1587502353	Patriots	nfl	Its not like our OLine is a lot better than the colts, if hes concerned for his own health and safety I dont see the difference.
fo4d9lo	1587502356	49ers	nfl	This is how I feel about 2016current Jed too. He made a ton of mistakes and was a douche bag when he was an egotistical young owner, but hes very clearly shown that his priority has become sitting back and let qualified people run the show, in addition to showing true passion for the team and care for the fans.
fo4d90r	1587502348	Chargers	team	Yes. He potentially the greatest player of the franchise
fo4d92o	1587502349	Raiders	team	Still praying for TNF. With the draft not being in Vegas this year I wouldnt be surprised if Davis gets TNF as an apology. Bradys new team, Grudens revenge game (x2), Raiders LV grand opening, etc. You want that as your 1st game of the season especially after the lost revenue from the draft, game 1 has to be the biggest game.
fo4d9ae	1587502352	49ers	nfl	You had 2003.
fo4d9fm	1587502354	Colts	nfl	No thank you
fo4d9on	1587502357	Patriots	team	F it. Lets come full circle and use that pick to draft Moss
fo4d9qe	1587502358	Ravens	nfl	Very few if any of my examples were big egos and off the field issues. Simply one or the other.
fo4d9sk	1587502359	Patriots	nfl	Would have figured it would be Hernandez coming from the top rope
fo4d96v	1587502351	Patriots	team	Exactly. Hate for gronk with this move is absurd. Pats tried to trade him in his final year, so first of all he owes no loyalty. Then he needed time to physically and mentally recover after what was clearly an exhausting last year for him. Now he gets a chance to go play with Tom for one last run with a contender. We get comp we wouldnt have had otherwise, and get to watch maybe the two greatest patriots ever go for it together again. I love everything about this.
fo4d9b8	1587502352	Colts	nfl	You shut your whore mouth
fo4d9g2	1587502354	Bears	team	Jesus just give me my glass of bleach now
fo4d9j7	1587502355	Jets	team	Thanks. Gibsons a really interesting as a prospect. Great sizespeed combo and fantastic big play ability. My only real concern with him is that he has had so few reps as a RB. Hes raw and will need some time to develop. Ive seen projections on him anywhere from the 4th to the 6th. The 4th is too high for me, the 5th I could live with, and Id be ecstatic if we could get him with our first 6th round pick.
fo4da1c	1587502362	Rams	team	Kendricks couldnt catch
fo4d9oj	1587502357	Patriots	nfl	Maybe Peyton is also feeling back to his old form and wants to play again.
fo4d9sh	1587502359	Patriots	team	People wanted color rush ONLY WITH WHITE HELMETS. This is an intentionally obtuse take
fo4d9vy	1587502360	Giants	team	They actually have hit before and have some Giants reporters that follow it. I know it seems weird but they may actually have some connections.
fo4da2n	1587502363	Bears	nfl	It is faster but The tech is out there where you can get a good wireless mouse for not too much more.A lot more gaming pros are starting to go wireless, I dont think theyd choose the worse option if they thought it would impact their potential 
fo4da31	1587502363	Lions	team	Thats why people thought Brate would be moved last offseason. But apparently Howard has worn out his welcome in Tampa so they are looking to move him.
fo4da30	1587502363	Patriots	team	Lol omg what a dumb take
fo4da9o	1587502366	Jets	nfl	Damn to bad you guys lost them
fo4d9oz	1587502358	Vikings	nfl	Fuck it go get Moss
fo4d9so	1587502359	Bears	nfl	Or Chase Young. Nobody talking about the Bucs line still not being very good
fo4d9xd	1587502361	Giants	team	I know, I was aiming my statement at the tweeter
fo4d9ym	1587502361	49ers	nfl	I only watch when I get a chanceIve actually missed like 5 weeks of games over a 20 year period
fo4da2i	1587502363	Patriots	team	Sorry I havent looked through the posts and it came up on my insta feed... I feel so betrayed
fo4da9m	1587502365	Bears	team	Something tells me he is going to start incorporating one
fo4daeo	1587502368	Eagles	team	Just think of all the GayCoxJohnsonetc jokes! Im in.
fo4d9z6	1587502362	Eagles	team	Technically, he goes by William Gay Jr.So how will your brother and dad feel about this?
fo4da4h	1587502364	Jaguars	nfl	Is the new CBA in effect yet?
fo4dabz	1587502366	Jets	nfl	I just think it wouldve been a one score game with Sam in. The final score was 316, but our defense actually played very well that game. You guys had two defensive touchdowns and the only two offensive touchdowns came on short fields. I think that game wouldve ended up a defensive struggle with Sam in with a final score around 1713. We probably wouldnt win, but the Eagles werent exactly a great team last year.
fo4daho	1587502369	Patriots	nfl	Patriots still fucking yo shit fam. Wish you and Matty Ice the best.
fo4dai9	1587502369	Patriots	team	We literally just got a free fourthround pick. Who cares. We have no idea if he will be as dominant as he used to be. Different system, time without playing, etc etc.
fo4dahf	1587502369	Patriots	team	 greedy fucking slutsI hope you mean Bill, because if they had been just a touch less greedy and disrespectful, both of them would have retired Patriots.
fo4dajs	1587502370	Patriots	nfl	Marvel movies are just bad movies wall to wall. After about the fourth one I realized a movie having characters I like is not the same as being a movie I like.
fo4danq	1587502371	Patriots	nfl	Glazer is generally excellent.  The coronavirus thing was dumb but he is usually spot on
fo4da5j	1587502364	Eagles	team	Thank you for catching that
fo4dalz	1587502370	Patriots	team	Trade Edelman for a 2nd rounder?
fo4daqa	1587502372	Giants	team	I was of the same opinion as well as I have Wills as my number 1 OT in this draft. I would love to have him on the team.
fo4dask	1587502373	Patriots	team	This is the correct take. People are acting like we had Gronk on the roster and in his prime, and we traded him for a 4th round pick. He wasnt coming back for anybody but Brady. Plus, physically he lost a lot of weight and just because hes pain free now, theres no guarantee that after one game hes not back to being miserable. This is a big win for the Patriots that only feels like a loss because people have ridiculous expectations.
fo4dagu	1587502368	Colts	nfl	Needs to return from his fortress of solitude and refuse to kneel before Zod
fo4daie	1587502369	Vikings	nfl	As a Vikings fan, I would trade spots with a Patriots fan in a second even if it meant the Pats never won another ring as long as I live.
fo4dakq	1587502370	Browns	team	One might even say its started to become kinda cringey
fo4dasa	1587502373	Colts	team	I remember one specific play to Hopkins where Hooker bites on play action and Hopkins runs right by him for a long touchdown in cover 2. As for Geathers, he was benched for Willis shortly after this game if I recall correctly.Was it one play? Sure. But it was a crushing play, and its specifically the kind of play that Cover 2 is designed to prevent. There is a safety on each half of the field who has to keep track of when the other teams best receiver is running free on your side of the field. Thats the guy that you spent the 15 pick on making that mistake.
fo4db5f	1587502378	Raiders	nfl	Broncos please trade up and take Ruggs.Id like one CeeDee Lamb aka the YAC Monster, please.
fo4daqs	1587502372	Buccaneers	nfl	You dont allow it. That wont stop everyone else doing it.
fo4daup	1587502374	Steelers	nfl	One season with Brady and since hes already in Florida, 2021 Gronk and Minshew connection. Florida Man will have evolved into something the world isnt ready to handle.
fo4dba7	1587502379	Bears	nfl	We ignoring the oline or....
fo4dbdg	1587502381	Patriots	team	What a fucking joke. No!!!
fo4db6w	1587502378	Giants	nfl	Or the dolphins or bucs
fo4dbhj	1587502382	Dolphins	team	Idk, I could go for some wings right about now
fo4dbio	1587502383	Patriots	nfl	But we are OK with that. Brady gave us 20 great years and gronk gave us 9 or so. Its not like watching Revis win a superbowl in New England. I would say most Pats fans are rooting for Brady to make it to the SB.
fo4db4a	1587502377	Browns	nfl	Why?
fo4dbj5	1587502383	Eagles	team	Personally, I feel CB is our second most immediate need this season, even more than LB. Mills is gonna see Safety, Slot, and OLB snaps this season much like Malcolm did, but I dont think there is an answer at the other outside CB spot opposite of Slay. Dantzler is very good at our type of defense physical, bracket corner play. Hell be gone by 103.
fo4dbky	1587502384	Saints	nfl	Have fun finishing in 4th
fo4dban	1587502380	Buccaneers	team	Yo waddup I used to be a pats fan but now Im a wicked huge bucs fan
fo4dbho	1587502382	Bills	team	It would be really wholesome and nice if the rest of the NFC South banded together this season to kick the ever living shit out of the Buccs.
fo4dbyj	1587502389	Falcons	team	I think youre writing Tom off a little too early.  His WRs were not getting any separation and he was still very efficient and no matter how you view him, hes still an upgrade over Jameis.  Bruce Arians is also one of the best HC in the league rn.  As for Gronk, hes only been out for a year and his last game, he had the game changing catch that won them the Superbowl.  They still have a chemistry together.  Hes not gonna be the same gronk, but hes also behind OJ Howard as well.  Currently, Id see us trading wins at this point but the draft is what really matters.
fo4dc1b	1587502390	Patriots	nfl	Thats just what 70 of his production would be Ill be surprised if he actually puts that up.
fo4dbhb	1587502382	Patriots	team	After thinking about it . We gave up a 7th and a player that wasnt going to play. There was only 1 team to deal him too. It doesnt even matter if Gronk plays good or bad. It wasnt going to be here. I was surprised at 1st at not more value. After some thought, imo the deal is fine.
fo4dbs0	1587502386	49ers	nfl	WOW
fo4dbs9	1587502386	Bears	nfl	Is this just a commonality with every reddit team sub, or is it specific to the Bears sub? Because its been so incredibly frustrating being on it and having an opinion thats anything short of Trubisky being the second coming. Seriously, he could continue to be just as terrible for the next decade and every year itd be the same litany of excuses... His first year doesnt count, and he only had one year in college, so really this is only his Xth season, and he didnt have an OL or weapons, and its a really complex system, and Nagy doesnt play to his strengths, and did you see his game against the Bucs? He was a pro bowler in 2018, so if we can just do X, Y, and Z, hell get over this little slump.
fo4dbso	1587502387	Colts	nfl	Ah, sneaky delete failed, guess I should have paid more attention to the Pats. Thank you.The deleted comment read What? Has he gone down so much that hes only worth a 4th? Is it because of his contract?
fo4dbv0	1587502388	Ravens	nfl	Yeah but if you lower them down to the level of an average NFL QB hes not that good
fo4dc0l	1587502390	Redskins	team	 The Redskins made the genius decision to draft a QB with your first round pick in 2019 then fire the coach halfway through the season! Now leaving your Franchise QB without the coach who drafted him Most reports suggest Gruden didnt want Haskins, which is why he was reluctant to play him (not just because he was newrawundeveloped). Haskins and his role were merely the demonstration of the different mindsets of Gruden and the front office. Gruden wasnt the guy who drafted him, according to most.Ron Rivera has a reputation for being an aggressive offensive playcaller (Riverboat Ron, for his gambling style), and anyone who was hired would definitely make some changes to the offenses approach for the 16 ppg reason you mentioned.
fo4dc6u	1587502392	Giants	team	Brady in colder weather. Even better
fo4dc9p	1587502393	Redskins	team	The counterpoint Id make to offering anything is that he will be looking to get paid in 1(2 if we accept his option) year
fo4dbw0	1587502388	Patriots	nfl	He had to be trolling with this one
fo4dbw7	1587502388	Rams	nfl	Yeah, thats what I kinda meant. Sure, it is a free pick. Because Gronk wasnt going to play for you. But its also less than his actual value. Not trying to say the Pats are dumb for this trade. Just throwing it out there that isnt isnt some fantastic deal for them.
fo4dbwr	1587502388	Ravens	nfl	That means the numbers between 1  4
fo4dc2l	1587502390	Raiders	team	I dont know, if Jordan Reed is still kicking, I think Gronk can handle a couple more.
fo4dc2n	1587502390	Saints	nfl	When hes on the field hes absolutely dominant, but most people seem to forget that hes missed roughly 13? of games due to injury.Along with the Brady trade, this would have shook me five or six years ago. Now its just like....meh.
fo4dc76	1587502392	Panthers	team	Lose for Lawrence Here We Come!
fo4dcki	1587502397	Patriots	team	Thanks for being respectful!
fo4dbz2	1587502389	Giants	team	Agreed. The fact that Gettleman is a big character guy would make it seem that Simmons isnt our pick, given the lack of interviews. Hes also apparently not one for smokescreens. Weve interviewed someone at a position we dont need in Herbert so its bizarre that the giants wouldnt interview Simmons given our position.
fo4dc5p	1587502392	Patriots	nfl	No it isnt. The situations are different. Gronk opting for easier life in Tampa after an inner circle HOF career isnt the same as being happy to win a single super bowl over 5
fo4dcb1	1587502393	Dolphins	team	Every day they make a scenario that could be worse and worse for us
fo4dc7l	1587502392	Cowboys	nfl	Right. And TB is counting on a QB more than a decade older than Vick who will be playing without BB for the first time in his NFL career.
fo4dce3	1587502395	Panthers	team	Say it with me folks tank for Trevor! Tank for Trevor!
fo4dcir	1587502396	Patriots	team	if you have gronkowski you make room for gronkowski
fo4dcoc	1587502398	Buccaneers	nfl	Ah yes, noted NFL legend Vince Young lol
fo4dceo	1587502395	Bears	team	I agree Brate will be nice too, OJ has a much higher upside and is younger though
fo4dcm4	1587502397	Patriots	nfl	Although I think that Bill is a big reason that Gronk retired and came out of retirement for another team. He didnt seem to vibe in Belichicks no fun system.
fo4dd0c	1587502403	Bills	nfl	Is Gronk still under contract or did the pats just trade his rights? Do the Buccs have to pay what he would have been set to make in whatever year of his contract this season would be or do they have to resign him before the start of the season?
fo4dd1l	1587502403	Buccaneers	team	 may or may not be playedI think you underestimate the NFL.It may not start on time. It may not be in front of fans. But I will be STUNNED if the NFL cancels their season. Their hubris, and desire for TV ad revenue, will be all they need to proceed.If you take away this season, youre going to have to pry it out of the NFLs cold, dead fingers. P
fo4dd39	1587502404	49ers	nfl	My god the NFC South is going to be a warzone.    Anybody know what the record is for most yards thrown total in a division?
fo4dcor	1587502398	Jaguars	team	I think the game has evolved past Mike Leach
fo4dcpy	1587502399	Buccaneers	team	I called it!
fo4dcqo	1587502399	Eagles	nfl	Its the remix to ignition
fo4dcul	1587502401	Saints	team	Doesnt it scare you a little bit of Bruce Arians, Mike Evan, Godwin, Gronkowski all on the same team?
fo4dcwh	1587502401	Giants	team	Dan Duggan (writer for The Athletic) follows the page which is interesting. Seems likely well pick a tackle with this and betting odds
fo4dd1x	1587502403	49ers	nfl	Thats why I would prefer CeeDee or Jeudy but thats splitting hairs.
fo4dd5d	1587502404	Seahawks	nfl	thats a shame. terrible game with an entertaining ending steelers vs. browns nov 14 2019great game (subjectively) saints vs. texans week 1 2019
fo4dd98	1587502406	Seahawks	nfl	The fact that you cant just admit youre wrong that the TIME GRONK PLAYED hes wasnt a top 10 TE is crazy. Youre bringing up stuff like his TDs compared to guys that played 16 games. Just stupid. I cant believe I wasted my time on someone who clearly wont admit theyre wrong even though its obvious. I admitted saying he was top 3 was a stretch but saying hes not top 10 is clearly a stretch too.
fo4ddew	1587502409	Bills	nfl	Jeeeeeeeeezus Christ
fo4ddgh	1587502409	Patriots	nfl	I would be happy reading Edelman if we got OJ
fo4ddi0	1587502410	Vikings	team	This was fun to watch. Tomasson is the fucking worst lol. Love that Spielman shut him down multiple times.
fo4ddl0	1587502411	Patriots	team	This makes me wonder if Tom had stayed, would we be getting Gronk  back?  Was there something going on behind the scenes that made Gronk not want to play for the Pats?  This is all very interesting, and maybe a little painful to watch unfold.
fo4dd5u	1587502405	Lions	team	I just saw BQs set up in another thread in here. Its actually better than JRobs!
fo4dd6m	1587502405	Cowboys	nfl	Well, youre a fan of the Iggles, so no big surprise there.  Glad to hear youve come around, at least somewhat, now that hes gone from the field.
fo4dd7k	1587502405	Chargers	team	After the ball playoff game
fo4ddcl	1587502408	49ers	nfl	The offense wasnt the problem, it was the defense that was massively overrated
fo4dde0	1587502408	Patriots	team	Leave it to a Daily Caller journalist to tweet this nonsense
fo4ddk4	1587502411	Falcons	team	Im so tired of people outside the division saying we should be scared of the Bucs. First of all, that offensive line is absolute fucking garbage. Adding unproven college talent or another teams backups wont change that. Second of all, they added over a decades worth of wear and tear to their QB position. Im not scared. FTB and FTS.
fo4ddkj	1587502411	Redskins	team	I dont really know any teams that is dying for a Te but I cant rule this out
fo4ddv0	1587502415	Patriots	team	so was no one here ever Pats fans to begin with? Sub looks like the fucking GSW subreddit.
fo4ddxo	1587502416	Buccaneers	team	Im still a pats fan. Just gonna follow the bucs until theyre done and then Ill just like them, like how I like the colorado avalanche for getting Bourques name on the cup.
fo4ddxy	1587502416	Giants	nfl	reinstate Josh Gordon.
fo4ddzx	1587502417	Jets	team	Ive been on record saying that I like Jeudy more but Ive been watching tape on both and I just dont know anymore. Id be happy with either WR. Jeudy  Better Route runner. Played against better competition. Con Body Catcher, Didnt go up against quality man coverage much. Lamb  Better hands and more of a natural pass catcher. Great size and monster after the catch. Cons Didnt play against NFL type defenses. Id be happy with either.
fo4ddl2	1587502411	Eagles	team	Gonna have to bring Chris back for Gay Long Cox
fo4ddv2	1587502415	Patriots	team	It apparently got better after getting rid of Hargreaves.
fo4de3j	1587502418	Seahawks	nfl	Leroy had it first.
fo4de4v	1587502418	Buccaneers	team	Edelman said foxborough forever dont worry
fo4ddmy	1587502412	Patriots	team	Hell probably lose that after getting drunk and wrestling an alligator.
fo4de8h	1587502420	Jets	nfl	Ill tell you what youll do, youll watch them in a Bucs uniform while they could have been going for Superbowls in Patriots uniforms.
fo4de9f	1587502420	Bills	team	I dont say this lightly, but if the Pegulas fuck up what weve got going with Beane  McDermott with their shitty attitudes and business practices, I am actually done with this team.Season tickets gone, fandom done. We finally have a functional front office, my heart cant take owners blowing that.
fo4dduq	1587502415	Chiefs	team	Are there a lot of planeteers over here?
fo4de8j	1587502420	Patriots	team	according to the release(httpswww.patriots.comnewspatriotsunveilnewuniformsaheadof2020season)NFL rules state that teams can only use one helmet for the season, and silver helmets have come to represent the modern era of the New England Patriots.
fo4dedm	1587502422	Raiders	nfl	You cant just retire to end a contract. Otherwise no contact would hold any weight.
fo4deir	1587502423	Buccaneers	team	FUCK OFF
fo4demi	1587502425	Lions	nfl	Gronk who?
fo4de81	1587502419	Buccaneers	nfl	BOOM Gronk reunited with TB in TB. No Belichick, no snow. The NFLs biggest story just got even bigger. Good luck stopping the Bucs offense. Good luck keeping the Bucs from becoming 1st team ever to play in a home Super Bowl.
fo4de9n	1587502420	Jets	team	I hadnt studied much on him but those are some encouraging traits. Definitely will need to learn more about him!
fo4deb0	1587502420	Chiefs	nfl	There never was random tests for weed. There was one test a year for weed, at a knowed date at training camp. Only if you were stupid enough to fail that test would you be subjected to random test for the next year
fo4deb4	1587502420	Eagles	team	Damn I wish my dad wasnt dead that would have been even funnier
fo4dect	1587502421	Vikings	nfl	Hes texting Belichick right now.. being toxic, hoping it gets him to break up with him so he can go to Brady.
fo4dedh	1587502421	Ravens	nfl	Revis had a shorter prime then Deion.
fo4defw	1587502422	Patriots	nfl	Can you guys fit Gilmore in that cap LMAO???
fo4dete	1587502428	Bengals	nfl	what happened with dez anyway?
fo4defg	1587502422	Patriots	team	Whats the point of having a 34 year old receiver during a rebuild?
fo4deh0	1587502423	Patriots	team	In 2020? Maybe none. Just like everyone else.
fo4des8	1587502427	Broncos	team	True.It is only weird if it does not work.
fo4dev1	1587502428	Colts	nfl	Beautiful.And we lose to the Chargers in the playoffs with a gamesealing INT from Rivers, because what else is gonna happen
fo4df2o	1587502431	Patriots	team	This is not only ahistorical, but wrong. Do you understand what roster management is?Im saying Tom fucking Brady had a lot to do with the super bowls in the past 7 years. I didnt know that was somehow an unpopular opinion.  Citation needed. Find me a team made of only free agent signings aside from the QB. Ill wait.Your twisting my words to be only. I never said the only people on the team were free agents. I said the major contributing pieces were either A) free agent signings or B) drafted in or before the draft in 2013.
fo4dek1	1587502424	Eagles	nfl	Because comparing people protesting police brutality and social injustice to inmates is in no way socially acceptable. Even if he misspoke on the phrase, the core phrase is extremely insensitive to the topic at hand.
fo4detv	1587502428	Bears	team	I like the mid round Safety class (though the 2nd round is really full up of high grade talent). The sweet spot for Guard imo is 3rd round so they are perfect if the Bears trade back. I wouldnt hate a WR in the 2nd but it has to be one of like three guys that I have as first round talents. Ideally to me it is trading back 43 (grabbing a late 2nd and a 3rd), using 50 on either Diggs, Terrell (Hes my CB2 and I think hes gone really early but still) or Arnette and in the late 2nd grabbing Hamler (if hes still there) or a safety and using the 3rd on someone like Hunt, Muti or Bredeson
fo4df1z	1587502431	Patriots	team	How is this a dumb take? Would you feel good with shipping Jules off to the Bucs for a bag of skittles next?
fo4dfb8	1587502435	Packers	nfl	I had to look up what RAS was and yikes
fo4deri	1587502427	Bengals	nfl	No shit, is that what I said?
fo4desh	1587502427	Patriots	team	Literally impossible, this isnt the movie draft day my guy.
fo4dex7	1587502429	Colts	team	News like this hurt me way too much. It only makes me hope for his return...
fo4dezt	1587502430	Bears	nfl	the 80s were 40 years ago tho
fo4df5g	1587502433	Jets	nfl	Id rather be us than the Dolphins right now, Tannehill you can take a victory lap on but I bet if he had Derrick Henry  your line in Miami he wouldve played better. He was hurt 2 of the 3 years too.
fo4dfao	1587502434	Chiefs	team	Lamar absolutely is top tier, and Ive never been a particularly huge fan of his. He had no one at offensive skill positions this year and took his team to the playoffs. Theres nothing to argue imo
fo4dfc3	1587502435	Cowboys	team	Precisely.  Duvernay in the 3rd or 4th, Proche in the 5th or 6th.  We dont need an elite WR, just one to be capable of catching 1520 passes for 700 yards and a handful of TDS
fo4dfh7	1587502437	Patriots	team	gronk  snake
fo4dew2	1587502429	Buccaneers	nfl	Brady has a hell of a lot more consistency than Vick ever had.
fo4df4w	1587502432	Patriots	team	Traitors is signing with the Jets. This is you being a child
fo4dfj9	1587502438	Bears	team	Thats not saying much. I still wouldnt want Baker.
fo4dfjt	1587502438	Packers	nfl	I mean hes certainly an upgrade over the jimmy graham weve seen the last two seasons in my opinion. That or we roll with sternberger
fo4dfov	1587502440	Jaguars	nfl	dont like the two all blue uniforms, but the home and away variants are nice as hell.
fo4dfsc	1587502441	Buccaneers	team	Just a fourth for gronk and a seventh? I think bellichik got robbed on this one tbh. If I was BB Id be wondering why gronk is going to brady over myself. Very interesting.
fo4df6l	1587502433	Bears	team	Im glad we didnt have the chance.  A second rounder for a kicker is ridiculous
fo4dff6	1587502436	Patriots	team	Doubtful.The timeline of our team just didnt fit Tom, which is why he left. If Tom stays Gronk never plays for another team even if he comes out of retirement.
fo4dfhu	1587502437	Patriots	team	Same way someone stopped us in 2007. Any given Sunday
fo4dfsp	1587502441	Patriots	nfl	Fuck I was really hoping to watch this video and be all likeFUCK YOU THAT WAS AN ARRESTABLE DIRTY HIT!! LOB MY ASS. But alas. Great play.
fo4dg1w	1587502445	Ravens	nfl	People had made the switch to 360 en mass by then. The 360ps3 platform 09 Madden was garbo.
fo4dfka	1587502438	Patriots	team	Boop
fo4dfvd	1587502442	Colts	team	He missed five tackles in 2018.And Khari Willis, who the OP claims is a remarkably better tackler, also missed eight tackles last season.
fo4dg7i	1587502447	Browns	team	If Okudah is there at 10 I would do backflips in joy lol. Who cares if we have picked two CBs recently, Jeff Okudah is on another level talent wise.
fo4dfrc	1587502441	Panthers	team	The pro wrestler? Wtf...the Bucs must be desperate.
fo4dfwl	1587502443	Patriots	team	Its not about passing on free draft capital, its about the idea that we hold no leverage in the deal. There is no negative situation in this for the pats. We held gronk rights with no cost to us, and if Tampa wants them they have to pony up for something. If the pats thought that a 7th was too cheap, they could easily say no, do better, until the price was right.
fo4dfzm	1587502444	Patriots	team	Wed also get the best TE in the history of the league to be contractually obligated to play for us. If he truly would not play he would not be reinstated.I dont buy this. We had more leverage than people think. We just didnt want to put any more dirt on our reputation.
fo4dg5r	1587502446	Redskins	nfl	He could but I feel like players hold less leverage when theyre on a contract they themselves have already agreed to. It definitely happens but just not as often as the rookie contract holdouts.
fo4dg7f	1587502447	Buccaneers	team	Im pretty sure this can only be explained by the fact that I must have slipped on some queso while watching the superbowl this year, and this is all some crazy fever dream and Im actually lying on my kitchen floor with the bowl of tortilla chips I knocked over on my way down about to hit me in the face.Oh well... Hope the Niners can pull this one off, Lynch deserves this.
fo4dgfh	1587502450	Eagles	nfl	YOURE SENDING ME MIXED MESSAGES, VISSASS!
fo4dfxv	1587502443	Patriots	team	Really? Im enjoying the chaos. Its obvious that we were gonna need a few years to get good again after Brady left (which was kinda expected). Why are people angry he may win for the Bucs?
fo4dg09	1587502444	Patriots	nfl	What
fo4dg2z	1587502445	Chiefs	team	Queen is rated considerably above the 2nd RD LBs on nearly every board Ive reviewed, hence the move upOver the people in this draft, but you need to look at the team youre drafting for. Theres players that will improve our team and still let us keep 2 important picks next year. I would be wary of trading a 1st and 4th for just about anything but a current AllPro LB.
fo4dg4e	1587502446	Patriots	team	Yeah I dont think many, but the fact he came out of retirement for the bucs and not us hurts like a Mother fucker...
fo4dgi8	1587502451	Ravens	nfl	Theres no precedent for a suspension due to civil matters and anything falling under conduct detrimental should have his time out of the league count as games served.There is historical precedent for that, but the league is insanely inconsistent. Even if they suspended him 24 games for PR he doesnt take a roster spot or cap space for that time, so no big loss.
fo4dgn6	1587502453	Dolphins	nfl	What do you think OJ is worth in a trade? What do you think OJ is worth in a trade now?
fo4dgok	1587502453	49ers	nfl	Patriots traded him  a 7th round for a 4th round.
fo4dgr9	1587502454	49ers	nfl	Definitely, I just dont know if that shell and a 7th is worth a 4th rounder. Hope Im proven wrong, but well see.
fo4dfyz	1587502444	49ers	team	Hold up. Arent you playing at draft expert right now?
fo4dg6j	1587502447	Packers	nfl	Would it be a hot take to say the Bucs will be good, since theyre hyped to do so well that we expect them to be average?
fo4dgj2	1587502451	Patriots	team	The return is good. He wasnt gonna play for the Pats ever. I think people, like myself, are irked that maybe Bills personality finally got in the way of whats best for the team. Having Gronk last year would have made the offense better and possibly led to Brady staying .
fo4dgj1	1587502451	Browns	team	They werent willing to part with 41 to get him on a multi year deal.  They arent parting with 14 for a rental.
fo4dgjg	1587502451	Patriots	nfl	I wonder what Gronks role will be this season. I highly doubt that he wants to put his hand down on the line the majority of plays. It depends on Gronks agility and speed, but the Bucs may use him in an HBack  Slot role more than a traditional TE.
fo4dgns	1587502453	Buccaneers	team	This was from the AFC championship vs the chiefs in 2018 if anyone was wondering
fo4dgt4	1587502455	Falcons	team	Get rid of the red gradient and make it solid red.
fo4dgtu	1587502455	Redskins	nfl	Hell, Im honestly game for this. I would even do it for 2 2nds.
fo4dgw7	1587502456	Patriots	nfl	Pain
fo4dgf6	1587502450	Patriots	team	If a team (realistically the Bucs) would give a decent (4) pick for Edelman, Id do it in a heartbeat. Hes been great, but hes not in the long or even medium term plans for the Pats.
fo4dgmt	1587502453	Patriots	team	Yeah wouldve been great to get Howard worked into the deal. But maybe it wasnt possible or wouldve cost too much.
fo4dgsg	1587502455	49ers	nfl	Just to add to that first point. During those 10 games he was 3rd in receiving yards behind Deebo, a rookie, and Kittle, who missed two games. He was good but I really dont think replacing his production necessitates burning the 13th pick on a wide receiver.
fo4dgo3	1587502453	Cowboys	nfl	I followed what you were saying. My point is that 60800 isnt out of the reasonable range.
fo4dh4i	1587502459	Patriots	nfl	Gilmore and our first to Detroit for their first and snipe Tua
fo4dh6b	1587502460	Bengals	nfl	Is everyone pretending that Gronk wasnt a shell of his former self the last season he played?
fo4dh7o	1587502461	Patriots	nfl	I honestly feel a little betrayed. Wish today didnt suck so much outside of dumb football news, but at least that trade value seems reasonable to me.
fo4dhgk	1587502464	Patriots	nfl	Yeah man, as long as they arent playing the Pats, Im rooting hard for the Brady and the Bucs.  Give him all the weapons he wants, I hope they destroy the league.  But fuck I hope that line can protect Brady.
fo4dhj4	1587502464	Patriots	team	Dont worry, hell retire. In about 10 years.
fo4dhl1	1587502465	Dolphins	team	Thank you for your service to the 2019 who the fuck is that defense
fo4dhrh	1587502467	Panthers	nfl	We win Lose for Lawrence Sorry folks
fo4dhrp	1587502468	Giants	nfl	And an AFC team needs to sign him. So he can beat Brady in the super bowl again.
fo4dhvw	1587502469	Buccaneers	team	What happens with OJ and Cam now?
fo4di19	1587502471	Broncos	team	Its going to be nice to watch Lock, Sutton, Jeudy, Fant and the LindsayGordon combo match these teams
fo4dhj0	1587502464	Patriots	nfl	What do you mean?  Gronks cap hit was 0, and now its 0.
fo4dhuz	1587502469	Patriots	nfl	Patriots fans not knowing this story existed waking up to their heart being crushed
fo4di1v	1587502472	Bears	nfl	Unsubscribe
fo4di2o	1587502472	Chargers	nfl	Deion had a longer peak, was a more versitile weapon, and made a larger impact on the sport than Revis did.
fo4di5q	1587502473	Patriots	nfl	If it was a healthy Gronk with only a one year, norisk, 10M fee, we might get a first (mostly because of the insane value on the contract).  But we are basically getting a 4th for the rights to Gronk, IF he comes out of retirement.
fo4di5u	1587502473	Patriots	team	Hes got Godwin and Evans. Goin to be nice.
fo4did4	1587502476	Chargers	team	God I do not want tua tbh I think Jameis Winston could do great in LA I realize how unpopular that opinion is
fo4di0h	1587502471	Colts	nfl	Troy Brown was a hell of a nickelback
fo4di9v	1587502475	Buccaneers	nfl	Im always wary of this team, let alone a bunch of older players. Im just excited the team should be competitive and theyll get some more nationally televised games.
fo4dikf	1587502479	Titans	team	Definitely. We need bodies at CB too, so this is smart business and good news.
fo4dimr	1587502480	Bears	nfl	This is such a meaningless stat now. People are vastly overrating Gronks current ability and value.
fo4difb	1587502477	Buccaneers	team	Gronk at 75 is still the best TE in the league, and I doubt he is asked to block as much nor is he going to be doubled all the time like he was in NE.Yes there was a physical and Gronk passed it
fo4dig4	1587502477	Patriots	team	There isnt any point to trading Jules honestly. The Bucs already have 2 WRs that are much better than him and have no reason to give up anything remotely valuable. Also, if there is any inkling that Stidham is our future QB, that will be crushed if we trade the only receiver that can catch. Stidham will mentally collapse if he was no one he can trust.
fo4digc	1587502477	Steelers	nfl	Please sign him. What could go wrong?
fo4dih6	1587502478	Lions	team	We usually wait until Round 3 to make the kill pick. Luckily, we have 2 third rounders this year to find their replacements I did note the s as well, but it is plausible lol. I think the draft will consist of OT, RB, WR, CB, DT, JACK, and S in some order.
fo4dihp	1587502478	Patriots	nfl	Im not upset. I love Gronk and am happy to see him play again. Im not even upset about what we got.
fo4disb	1587502482	Colts	team	God dammit
fo4di9h	1587502475	Colts	team	If we land Love at 34, I might cum everywhere all year long.
fo4dif4	1587502477	Cowboys	team	is it friday already?
fo4difa	1587502477	Bengals	team	If you dont take Burrow, Cincy riots and you lose whats left of your fan base. Also, whoever the Bengals would take instead of Burrow would have to take on the fact that nobody wanted them and they would definitely have to outperform Burrow in every way in order to not be hated. The only win that comes from that is if Burrow ends up being the biggest bust in NFL history.
fo4diiv	1587502478	Titans	team	He needs to go post that over on rbattlestations.
fo4dije	1587502479	Patriots	nfl	He missed throws he used to make and he sometimes refused to throw to receivers if they missed one pass.  He would under throw easy sideline passes that used to be second nature and his longer throws were iffy. Im the largest homer there is but 2019 Brady did show decline.
fo4dinz	1587502481	Patriots	team	6 months of all the food, training, rehab and roids he wants and thats just to get back to a weight his body has been at before. The frame is still the same I bet he gets close no problemo. Hollywood trainers put 40lbs onto guys like Christian bale in less than a year and hes not exactly Gronkian NFL pedigree genetics
fo4dix0	1587502484	49ers	nfl	Its almost like every NFL team plays against elite players and loaded teams during their schedule.
fo4diew	1587502477	Eagles	team	And comments like this is how I end up spitting water all over my desk during a work meeting. I really shouldnt be on reddit right now
fo4dinb	1587502480	Eagles	nfl	The lt gov of texas said see I was right, the economy is more important than liveshttpswww.newsweek.comtexasltgovdanpatrickfoxnewstuckercarlson1499106
fo4dio4	1587502481	Ravens	nfl	Pro Football Focus.
fo4djbk	1587502490	Cardinals	team	Wed have to go 214 with one of the losses going to the Bengals to be 1st overall. Im not sure wed be that bad enough to be in position to draft Burrows. Itd be Bosa  TuaHebert, and Im going to go with Murray  whoever we get this year.
fo4dixd	1587502484	Lions	team	Just watching through now, the Miami game looked pretty rough, though hes definitely a really good corner he got beat BAD a few times in that game.
fo4dj41	1587502487	Redskins	team	Gronk, Cameron brate, OJ. One is gonna get traded and it obviously wont be Gronk. They deff need another tackle but matching salary would be tricky if they went for Trent
fo4djaa	1587502490	Colts	nfl	Both him and Ballard are very candid, with clear expectations. Kept the deal quiet too.
fo4diwe	1587502484	Chiefs	team	The second round is supposed to be full of hidden gems. I would prefer to trade back and get two good players in that round if no elite prospects are still left at 32.
fo4diyn	1587502485	Panthers	team	And kraft just replaced Belichicks robotic parts with new ones made of adamantium so buckle up buckaroos
fo4dj92	1587502489	49ers	nfl	Damn. Bucs passing offense looking crazy, especially if they keep OJ Howard still. Dont know how I feel about this for Gronk tho, I get why hes coming back but physically he probably shouldve stayed retired. Relatively fair trade overall tho.
fo4djkk	1587502493	Cardinals	nfl	You people are genuinely impossible to speak with.  The public safety people are looking out for the safety of THE PUBLIC.  The individual is more than likely safe if not a person at risk.  Look at any of the provided numbers.  They obviously dont give a fuck and you people dont understand so theyre automatically stupid.
fo4dj23	1587502486	Cowboys	team	He perfected it because the pocket nearly always collapsed around him.
fo4dj3r	1587502487	Bears	team	...... it really does say much. OP said any QB can win at Okla or Bama which is 100 falsea
fo4dj6l	1587502488	Eagles	team	If he passes the test with Howie  Co, that is all that matters.  Go get him!Chemistry test?  This isnt Dr. Bunsen Honeydew hiring Beaker!
fo4dja0	1587502489	Chargers	team	Left picture rocks!!!... I would of liked all the yellow be powder blue on the dark navy and have the numbers not be white but same as the bolts, just outlined... the problem is, it wouldnt work for Olathe real deal until we can wear dark navy helmets as well. I also thought of the grey speculation that the bolts may look good on the dark navy if they were grey outlined in yellow.
fo4dji4	1587502493	Broncos	team	What? The only colors on their new uniforms that are halfway decent are the royal blue and the navy ones. The rest are terrible and the yellow pants are literally the worst design choice ever
fo4djkg	1587502493	Bills	nfl	Hard agree, I love this
fo4dj9t	1587502489	Buccaneers	team	As a Pats fan its good value for both sides. Im obviously thrilled with getting a 4th for basically nothing, and you guys get a top 10 TE and top 3 blocking TE if he puts his on his weight back and is healthy.
fo4djgl	1587502492	Buccaneers	nfl	Way off
fo4djly	1587502494	Chiefs	nfl	Okay, so I heard about Gronk. Do you think the Saints would be willing to trade a seventh round pick to the Chiefs for Kelce, Hill, Hardman, Matthieu, Jones, Watkins, Clark, and Pennel? I dont need a repeat, I want the Bucs to lose.
fo4dju8	1587502497	Giants	nfl	Bucs fans be like(httpsi.imgur.comvsRJWJH.gif)
fo4djka	1587502493	Patriots	team	Im calling it a 4 for 7 swap. Gronk was not going to play here so hes essentially a nothing as far as value is concerned for the patriots.
fo4djnh	1587502494	Texans	nfl	You either dont understand what Im saying or youre deliberately not understanding. I didnt cherry pick just 5 random games of Tua and say look if you regress his stats to the mean hes average hes average. No I took the 6 games where Alabama didnt out talent everyone on the other team. When Tua faced competition that was in equal in talent to Alabama he was at best mediocre. Any good college QB can throw for 5000 yards against Vanderbilt, The Citadel, Akron when they have potentially 6 or more 1st rounders on their offense. An NFL QB does it against the best college players,and Tua didnt.
fo4djr6	1587502496	Texans	team	Make sure you dont too triggered when the Texans win football games.
fo4djt2	1587502496	Titans	nfl	Going through the article I had to reread that like three times to figure out what they were trying to say there. My neighbor has a turtle named Pepe who likes to eat strawberries. Still dont see a reason why they put that part there.
fo4djzg	1587502499	Jets	team	I agree 100 and this is the take a lot of this sub needs to hear. Just because theres a big 4 of OTs doesnt mean were high on all 4 of them, every team is going to have their favorite(s), and others they arent as high on. I would also add the Chargers into the mix for an OT round 1 depending on how their QB rankings are and if they can get their guy, which further complicates things in front of us. Will all 5 of those teams go Oline? No, but there is a possibility the guys we do love are gone by then, and if Im an NFL GM, if I dont love my 4 OT thats sitting there, Im not risking it by reaching on him for the sole purpose of taking an OT. Hopefully one of our guys is there, but you cant go into the draft with tunnel vision and just assume everything is going to go your way, especially when youre out of the top 10.
fo4dk37	1587502500	Packers	team	Anything about the character concerns that we should know about or is it just stuff like he smoked pot and sometimes skipped class in college?
fo4dk77	1587502502	Patriots	nfl	Better one year early than one year late, and Bill wanted to trade Gronk years ago when he could have gotten more than a 4th. For whatever reason it didnt happen, my guess is it was disallowed. I think he would have moved on from Brady for Jimmy G, too, if it were deemed okay by Kraft.    Would that have been good? Who knows. Do they win that last SB? Probably not. Would they be in a much better spot now? Probably.
fo4dk7g	1587502502	Browns	nfl	Please do it
fo4dkl8	1587502507	Vikings	team	I could also see us going up for Kinlaw from 22 and RuizJones at 25 (although Im not a huge fan of Jones in the first).
fo4dkn4	1587502508	Raiders	team	potatoe(httpsnonproductive.comsidekicksthatmattermarchmadessthewinnerpotatoes)
fo4dkn7	1587502508	49ers	nfl	I personally think the Cardinals would be wise to trade him to the 49ers for a 7th.
fo4dket	1587502505	Patriots	nfl	edelman was an absolute nonfactor in 2011, I dont know why people keep bring him up
fo4dkvy	1587502512	Browns	team	Your fixation on cringe is cringey
fo4dkya	1587502512	Seahawks	nfl	i mean the gronk stuff i understand, the CBA changed to relax some rules around drug testing. we may never know if it was Brady that wanted out of NE or if BBKraft pushed him out.
fo4dkqw	1587502509	Patriots	team	This aged well.
fo4dkrk	1587502510	Patriots	team	Can I be completely honest? Yeah. Brady threw some really shitty balls last year you have to admit it. He blamed it on the receivers, now hes going into a place with even less experienced receivers (in terms of catching balls from brady) and you expect him to throw dimes every time. Watch the whole of last season again, when we were 70 Brady looked like the qb of a team that 34. Granted he still one of the better qbs in the NFL he isnt the same Brady, who need I remind you, doesnt like rookies. Which is technically this entire team as none of them have played with brady before, besides gronk, but he wont last long.
fo4dkur	1587502511	Raiders	nfl	Im sure were in close contact with all 3 top WRs
fo4dkw7	1587502512	Vikings	team	Wont get anywhere close to that for Dalvin. Plus I think that GB is content with the backs they have being they could have got like likes of Melvin Gordon or Todd Gurley with just giving up a salary and no draft capital.
fo4dkx7	1587502512	Patriots	nfl	Hes already retired and he isnt affecting the Pats cap(httpswww.nbcsports.combostonpatriotspatriotsofficiallyplacerobgronkowskireserveretiredlist). There was no pressure to trade him unless he actually unretired first.
fo4dl6k	1587502516	Bears	nfl	Nobody knows with that dude lol

fo4dl23	1587502514	Patriots	nfl	I expected less but hoped for better for a Hall of Fame tight end.I am sad.
fo4dlew	1587502519	Packers	team	It does depend on a lot, and i still think your expectations are skewed. We all want the Watt family level impact on year 1. That really shouldnt be the status quo. We want a topcaliber receiver, a possible number 1 on other teams. Personally Id also say contributing, is lower in terms of value than immediate impact. ...  mediocre for 2 to 3 years

fo4dlvd	1587502525	Steelers	nfl	The fuck does that have to do with being washed
fo4dm2k	1587502528	Seahawks	team	Honestly, after that Gronk trade, the Seahawks really need to fill the gap at pass rush if we want to make a run at the Super Bowl.
fo4dm51	1587502529	Dolphins	nfl	Goddamn
fo4dlni	1587502522	Jaguars	team	I love that in that scene, its Superman and Supermans Dad.
fo4dlwv	1587502526	Buccaneers	nfl	As an ex Patriots fan, Im pretty sure Brady still has enough in the tank for that to be a top 5 offense because of how good the receivers are. Im am concerned about the 10mil, though. We need help on the line, and Im sure that 10mil couldve been put to good work there
fo4dlyt	1587502526	Titans	nfl	Try not to suck any dick on the way through the parking lot
fo4dm1e	1587502527	Patriots	nfl	This makes it so much more enjoyable to root for the Bucs. In my lifetime Ive always been one of those my second favorite team is the team I hate the least blah blah But now? New England fans are in a pretty decent spot, we basically have two teams in the race this year lol.
fo4dm4o	1587502529	Bears	team	Nobody is trading for Trubisky.
fo4dm9u	1587502531	Patriots	team	Honestly, with everything Brady and Gronk have done for the team, Im not mad at.
fo4dmf2	1587502533	Giants	nfl	Its about the same the g pro has a 1ms response time and its counter parts in the logitech family like the 203, 403 and the G pro wired are 1412 of the price with a wire for 1ms response time.No one should pay 150 dollars to not have a wire when the 203 is
fo4dmgf	1587502533	Patriots	nfl	 They traded a 4th rounder for a dude who probably was not worth a 4th the last time he played, You, know, except for making amazing plays to help us win a SB.
fo4dmit	1587502534	Ravens	nfl	Did you watch Jordan?
fo4dmap	1587502531	Ravens	nfl	Why not run 2 tight end sets? I mean the Bucs dont have a decent third option at WR anyways.
fo4dmfp	1587502533	Patriots	nfl	Can center be eligible receiver?
fo4dmhv	1587502534	Buccaneers	team	Jesus Christ I get in and out of the shower and all this shit happens.  Ill be cheering you piratey fuckers on next year.
fo4dmnk	1587502536	Packers	nfl	Warren sapp who? Julius peppers who?
fo4dmp1	1587502536	Vikings	team	Yea. AP missed a lot of time in college due to injury. Broken Collarbone cost him most of his junior? year. Mightve been been sophmore. As well as other nagging injuries. Durability and hands were the only concerns with AP coming out.
fo4dmqz	1587502537	Buccaneers	team	Im just glad you made it and this exists now. The frolick, the gulaginspired atmosphere of Squidwards house, its all just perfect.
fo4dm7e	1587502530	Patriots	nfl	Yeah I agree. At the same time they dont exactly owe us loyalty but fuck dude.
fo4dm7o	1587502530	Rams	nfl	Honestly its a good time for your rebuild because hell be retired again before youre done.
fo4dme9	1587502532	Titans	team	Theyre likely waiting until the draft is over so teams get desperate and have to overpay, unfortunately.
fo4dmf9	1587502533	Bills	team	I am so conflicted on TB this year.Part of me wants them to be terrible because fuck Brady (and now Gronk).The other part of me wants them to tear through the NFC so that those fan bases can deal with the shit we have been for two decades
fo4dmis	1587502534	Patriots	nfl	He was still under contract
fo4dmpj	1587502537	Redskins	team	Thats true but we are running out of options. I would like to get a TE at 3rd or 4th but outside of 3rd the TE (weak TE draft) we drafting is not gonna be any better. idk maybe Haskins doesnt need Te who knows...but I just know that Rivera likes his TEs
fo4dms5	1587502538	Steelers	nfl	No way gronk comes back to take a haircut. Pats wouldve owned him a little over 19m.
fo4dmv1	1587502539	Bears	nfl	Is Gronl gonna leave without dropping the belt? We need another screwjob
fo4dmki	1587502535	Patriots	nfl	In before PED suspension right before season starts
fo4dmoj	1587502536	Buccaneers	team	What
fo4dn8d	1587502544	Jets	nfl	Brady and Gronk are gonna be playing next year while youll be watching Jarrett Pick Six Stidham. Say whatever you want but that wont be fun.
fo4dmvh	1587502539	Colts	team	I dream of a perfect world where Grigson was never GM, Andy had all the protection he needed, the rest of the NFL is sick of the Colts always winning Super Bowls, and AdmiralLobstero gets to bang Taylor Swift.
fo4dn0r	1587502541	Giants	team	Nate solder is terrible.... gave up most sacks in his career last season at 12.5.... I do not want him protecting Jones.... Id rather trade him to close for nothing considering hes worth 15 million a year
fo4dn2o	1587502542	Patriots	team	Very pumped to see us score 14 points per game on offense this year. Very cool.
fo4dncm	1587502545	Patriots	team	I think anyone that can get past the emotion of it can immediately recognize that both teams are making out like bandits, this is the definition of a winwin trade. That said it really sucks from an emotional standpoint to know that both Brady and Gronk would rather play elsewhere. Its just a little bit of an extra kick in the nuts, one that you can get over, but it still sucks.
fo4dn0a	1587502541	Buccaneers	team	Gronks New Groove
fo4dn2c	1587502542	Panthers	team	So from 2010 to 2012, Hurney drafted 3 players that, at some point in their careers, were AllPro. Not sure you can really rag on him for that.
fo4dn4w	1587502543	Patriots	nfl	Also, CBD and weed. I dont think thats the biggest factor, but I certainly think its a considerable one.
fo4dn4v	1587502543	Patriots	team	Youre right, thats odd since Brady still follows Jules
fo4dna3	1587502544	Seahawks	nfl	Like Gronk
fo4dnbd	1587502545	Browns	nfl	Not at all. He is all business all the time. Needs to learn how to relax if you ask me.
fo4dnex	1587502546	Patriots	nfl	I mean he was still a decent TE. With Evans and Godwin taking attention away he could have a good year.
fo4dnj2	1587502548	Bears	nfl	this is insane haha.
fo4dn0o	1587502541	Browns	team	httpswww.dispatch.comarticle20150811NEWS308119766
fo4dn1t	1587502541	Raiders	team	Ill let you in on an insider secret dont click on mock draft posts.
fo4dnby	1587502545	Chargers	nfl	How did we get brought into this??? Chill bro
fo4dndh	1587502546	Chargers	team	Chris Harris was one of them. Doesnt mean much
fo4dnhf	1587502547	Patriots	team	Not really any leverage if you think about it. The Pats only had one team that Gronk would play for or stay retired.
fo4dntq	1587502552	Bears	team	it really does though. OP said any QB can win in Okla or Bama which is 100 false. Mitch goes 76 in 201718 if he were to play at Oklahoma
fo4dn9c	1587502544	Chiefs	team	Im on your side. But stick your toes in the moralless pool for a few seconds and have a chuckle!
fo4dnda	1587502546	Patriots	team	Did he unfollow him just now or when he left?
fo4dnjc	1587502548	Patriots	team	Plus now we have a 1st, 3 3rds, 2 4ths, a 5th, and like 5 late picks? Plenty of ammo there to move around the board, trade up, trade down, trade picks into 2021, grab a vetPretty amazing that people call BB a bad GM when following like 15 ten win seasons in a row we are entering a draft with like 12 picks
fo4dny6	1587502554	Browns	nfl	Patriots had his rights
fo4dnod	1587502550	Ravens	nfl	What do you think the overunder will be for the Bucs now? 10 wins?
fo4dnsk	1587502551	Eagles	nfl	Unreal
fo4dny1	1587502554	Cowboys	team	No, Bill Belichick is notorious for trading firstround draft picks for more draft picks, or lateround picks for players at a bargain. Not for trading first round picks for disgruntled players needing an impending contract extension. He did that once for Brandin Cooks, which ultimately didnt work out well for the Patriots but fortunately he was able to get a firstrounder back for him.I believe the 4 times you are referring to are the 4 times in the last 20 years where the Patriots didnt have a firstrounder as a result of trades. They were 2000 where they traded their firstrounder to acquire Bill Belichick from the Jets 2009 where they traded back out of the first round to acquire more draft picks 2013 where they traded out of the first to acquire more picks 2017 Cooks trade
fo4dnze	1587502554	Falcons	team	Im starting to think Henderson wont be there at 16. What I would be looking to do is stand pat at 16 and pray he makes it to you. Then trade back up into the end of the first again and look to grab ChiassonEpenessaMurray
fo4do3p	1587502555	Raiders	nfl	you retire personally meaning youre not playing anymore but the team still owns your rights to play.
fo4do4z	1587502556	Broncos	nfl	tarantinos best movie, dont  me
fo4dobj	1587502558	Broncos	nfl	the way things is going you might not play anyone next year
fo4do6e	1587502557	Cowboys	nfl	RIP Panthers. They might as well sign Trevor Lawrence right now.
fo4dob4	1587502558	Cardinals	nfl	I mean they have the 14th pick and its a deep class for OTs plus Gronk isnt necessarily a sure thing at this point so they should at least hold on to Brate if not both. Not like you can get a huge return for either anyway
fo4doh1	1587502560	Eagles	nfl	They still had him under contract. Same thing that happened with Marshawn. The Lions still have Calvin Johnsons contract
fo4dokl	1587502562	Raiders	team	Thursday night football is a punishment. Not a reward
fo4doo9	1587502563	Patriots	team	So we praise him because his acting like a fucking asshole and ditching the Patriots, and then doing everything he could to prevent Belichick going to the Patriots? Yeah, pass.
fo4dor3	1587502564	Buccaneers	team	RING SZN?Imagine it now, Lightning, Rays, and Bucs all winning the championship. Itll be Gasparilla 2.0
fo4dovp	1587502566	49ers	team	I know its about why the bengals should draft him but its a good read on him. httpswww.cincyjungle.complatformamp202041821196723nfldraftprofileappalachianstatelinebackerakeemdavisgaithercincinnatibengals
fo4doy5	1587502567	Panthers	team	Hurney has historically STRUGGLED on day 2 of the draft. You have to go back 8 drafts to find a plus NFL starter on day 2 of a Hurney draft (Kalil). Day 2 is fundamental to good football teams. (Seattle has made a living being great at Day 2). Unfortunately neither of his 2 drafts since hes been back have been able to inspire any confidence so far since the return of Hurney our day 2 picks have beenGreg LittleWill GrierDonte JacksonRashaan Gaulden. Day 2 drafting HAS to improve for us to complete a turnaround, hopefully that changes Friday.
fo4dp0t	1587502568	Cardinals	nfl	Yeah if AB does come back I think Baltimore is where he ends up.
fo4dp2p	1587502569	Cowboys	nfl	Thats WWE 247 Champion Rob Gronkowski! Put some respect on the belt!
fo4dp33	1587502569	Eagles	team	I wish
fo4dodh	1587502559	49ers	nfl	The NFC in just a couple seasons went from the Seahawks at the top and everyone else getting pushed around, to four legitimate playoff contenders. What Bidwell has done with the Cardinals is so impressive.
fo4dojc	1587502561	49ers	nfl	100 betrayed. This feels planned out by them. Ditch us because we dont have the talent of cap space for greener pastures.
fo4doji	1587502561	Panthers	team	Buffalo Panthers as they are still taking our players. This might just be a year thing for Tampa. Additionally, the Bucs have tradedsigned for players that are in a winnow mentality. The Bills have taken a lot of our younger players or who just had one contract with us.
fo4domk	1587502562	Bears	team	According to this article (httpsheavy.comsports202004nfldraftchicagobearsprospecttrackeramp?twitterimpressiontrue), the qbs the Bears have met with areBen DiNucci, James Madison Jake Fromm, GeorgiaSteven Montez, ColoradoJames Morgan, FIU All pretty clear day3 qbs, with the exception of Fromm and maybe Morgan. Dont expect anything big.
fo4domr	1587502563	Texans	team	You keep saying Im apologizing for Bob.  Please point where?  You think Clowney has value but the fact he is still a FA should prove to you that no one wanted him.  We actually got way better end of that deal than the Seahawks.  They gave us a 3rd a 5th and 2 players for a 1 year rental on an injured Clowney.  No one wanted him you cant trade a guy for a 1st round pick that people wont even pickup in FA.  You living in a fairy land world where you think people have value that dont.  And if you even mention the Hopkins trade Ill just point you back up to where I said it was terrible.  Bob did good things for this organization and turned us into a playoff team.  I dont think he can turn us into a SB team.  As Ive already said.  If you cant see BoB did that then you started watching the Texans in 2010 and only know us as a team thats been to the playoffs.  I started on 2002 and we lost for a fucking decade before Kubiak got us 2 playoff appearances.  Then he went 214 and thats the team Bob got with no QB.  So yes sorry I think Bob built us up a bit from a 214 team to a team that has made playoffs every year. And just FYI you part of the asshole problem as well.
fo4dooh	1587502563	Patriots	nfl	sigh youre telling me I have to buy TWO Bucs jerseys now?
fo4dop8	1587502563	Patriots	nfl	Yeah this guys being ridiculous, like all those coaches that try to fit players into a system as opposed to designing a system to fit his players. If his TE wants to murder, he needs to accept that.
fo4dosa	1587502565	Eagles	nfl	Bear The Fuck Down m
fo4dpad	1587502571	Packers	nfl	All they had to give up was lots of value and maybe guaranteed contracts like every other American league. Seriously Im still disappointed that CBA passed without really meaningful improvements and such a long term.
fo4dows	1587502566	Browns	team	Overpaying for someone with character concerns isnt realistic. Also, they already had the opportunity to get him for a 2nd rounder and didnt do it.
fo4dowu	1587502566	Patriots	nfl	Brady worked with Bill for 20 years and were the most successful duo in history.  LOL.
fo4dp0g	1587502568	Falcons	nfl	That will be almost 2 whole years ago when the season starts they are a lot older now Brady WAS 40 now he is IN his 40s! Quit living in the past man s
fo4dp23	1587502568	Cowboys	nfl	Florida Man Gronk incoming.
fo4dp4h	1587502569	Patriots	team	And what exactly do you think you have as an alternative?  NE has absolutely no leverage.  You should feel lucky you even got a 4th.
fo4dp5v	1587502570	Patriots	nfl	How does this work with his recent WWE career change?  Surely no football club is going to let him continue to do the WWE stuff and risk getting injured there, given he has a history already of injuries.  Was his WWE stint planned to be short term from the start?
fo4dpha	1587502574	Raiders	team	if buffstreams DOES go down, there might exist a site thats called somethin like sportsurge, and maybe there is a separate stream on there possibly called Crackstreams or something, idk, maybe. im not really sure. but probably.
fo4dpkn	1587502575	Seahawks	nfl	im glad the NFCW got the NFCS out of our system last year.
fo4dpky	1587502575	Buccaneers	nfl	Again.
fo4dp4s	1587502569	Eagles	team	Sorry man.
fo4dp7v	1587502570	Patriots	team	Now youve crossed the line.
fo4dpgp	1587502574	Buccaneers	team	So glad I already got my season tickets. Pre Brady signing.
fo4dpoh	1587502577	Patriots	team	After suffering last year without a gamechanging tight end which couldve easily made a run of it with a 1st round bye or 1 seed and now to lose the best QB and then have the TE come back but only for another team, is hard man.
fo4dp9v	1587502571	Buccaneers	team	This is unbelievable
fo4dpbs	1587502572	Eagles	nfl	Oh, I love him now. I tried to hate him, but he was just so great and insightful that hes my favorite and I retroactively feel a little worse about how much I shit on him for no reason when he was playing for you guys
fo4dplu	1587502576	Patriots	team	Was just listening to 98.5 the sports hub. Say what you will about them but they made a great point. Gronk cried and shouted from the mountain tops that CTE was effecting his brain and every day life. His transition to CBD showed us what he was willing to do to fix it. Now he just wants to come back like its nothing ? Was this all to get away from Bill?
fo4dpmj	1587502576	Patriots	team	We didnt get nothing in return for a retired TE who wasnt going to play here again. A 4th can be used as trade ammo to move around in the draft.
fo4dpvu	1587502579	Patriots	nfl	Oh for sure. If Gronks back holds up hell be a nightmare since teams cant double him
fo4dpog	1587502577	Buccaneers	team	Jesus, what fucking timeline are we in lol might as well rename the sub after this.
fo4dpt6	1587502578	Patriots	nfl	He only played one game with the Pats actually so extremely short leash
fo4dpxv	1587502580	Ravens	nfl	Seems like Ill be playing a lot of games against the Bucs for next years Madden (Been a Ravens fan since 96, cant help but love LJ on the cover D)
fo4dpzl	1587502581	Patriots	team	You mean its gonna suck watching them play poorly or it will suck for us to watch them play togetherwell on another team?
fo4dq1m	1587502582	Cowboys	team	The thing with OJ Howard is that he couldnt get touches in a very prolific, passhappy offense.He and Njoku have the measurables to be dominant. But it just never shows up on game day and you have to wonder why.I mean I wouldnt totally close the door on him. TEs take about 3 years to develop typically but you gotta wonder why he fell out of favor imo
fo4dptn	1587502578	Patriots	team	These are strange times...!
fo4dpyc	1587502580	Jaguars	nfl	The team that has smacked us around for whatever reason is the Philip Rivers led chargers. I dont care if were 120 and theyre 012. If we play them, we will get smacked unless they whole heartedly want to give us the win.
fo4dq34	1587502582	Patriots	team	i thought that was the titans
fo4dq7p	1587502584	Patriots	team	yep. need to make a hole, gronk goes out wide, you going to double him or leave him 1 v 1 , can basically see them running this a lot to make space for other tes or recievers
fo4dq8x	1587502585	Vikings	nfl	Tompa Bay Gronkaneers
fo4dq9a	1587502585	Jets	nfl	Fuck that.
fo4dpxi	1587502580	Giants	nfl	No takebacks on Bradberry
fo4dq5w	1587502583	Vikings	nfl	Year off to rest
fo4dq7k	1587502584	Texans	team	Make sure youre a good little boy and keep supporting OBrien while he loses games OK
fo4dq8b	1587502584	Buccaneers	team	You really think brady isnt going to have a say in Arians scheme? Lol youre naive. He wouldnt have checked off on this move without him and Arians being on the same page for using gronk. When a brady or a Manning moves teams, they run the offense they want, period, its GOAT privilege.
fo4dqrx	1587502592	49ers	team	Ehh not really. Back in the Harbaugh days, Kendall Hunter always had a higher YPC than Frank Gore despite the fact that Gore was clearly the better runner. Hunter was the change of pace back and Gore was the workhorse back. Their jobs were different, thus their YPC averages were different. Only using YPC to measure the talent of a running back is stupid.
fo4dqt4	1587502592	Chiefs	nfl	Well shit
fo4dqtl	1587502592	Packers	nfl	Luck Why do you think I came all this way?
fo4dqn2	1587502590	Patriots	team	I mean, they were 7th in average time spent on the field so its not like they were on the field that much.
fo4dqw1	1587502593	Patriots	team	Then they werent pats fans.  Thanks for the shit post
fo4dqw6	1587502593	Cardinals	nfl	Good point
fo4dr22	1587502596	Giants	nfl	Patriots sign Eli and beat brady in the SB.
fo4dr30	1587502596	Falcons	team	You know what, youre right, the economy is collapsing, but you know whats gonna happen? We go back to work, everyone is so happy because money is in their pockets, but then people get sick and people die, then what does it all mean? Sure you have money. But now you are dead, and that lady you met two days ago? She was compromised, and now shes dead to, so while you were so busy trying to go back to normal you killer yourself and someone with you. I hope you sleep well tonight with that on your conscience, and to think you had the audacity to call me ignorant
fo4dqih	1587502588	Buccaneers	team	Please take good care of my guys. I miss em already.
fo4dqmj	1587502590	49ers	nfl	But the memes
fo4dqsn	1587502592	49ers	nfl	They actually have a good defense. Elite run defense and alright pass defense
fo4dr98	1587502598	Saints	nfl	 This is the best set of weapons Brady has ever had right? I would also say this is the toughest set of division teams hell have ever had to face too, though.
fo4dqxg	1587502594	Broncos	nfl	Teams still obtain the rights to retired players. If gronk wanted to come back and play, he could only play for the Patriots if they refused to trade his rights
fo4dr0a	1587502595	Falcons	nfl	I just think that yall gave up on Jameis too early. Bruce Arians system is hard to learn in a year, just ask Carson Palmer. Will Brady throw less picks than Jameis? Of course, Brady is a way better QB at reading defenses and actually throwing the ball away. But the potential that Jameis had if you could cut away some of those interceptions would be worth wayyy more than Brady at the end of his career. You guys chose to play it safe, and well see how it turns out come this fall.
fo4dr0e	1587502595	Patriots	nfl	Remember when Devin McCourty and Duron Harmon called out Lane Johnson by name after going to their 5th and 4th SBs respectively while coming out with 3 rings while getting drunk and partying on a couple of duckboats?
fo4dr67	1587502597	Packers	team	I didnt even share my expectations so how can they be skewed?
fo4drki	1587502602	Cowboys	nfl	Refs you mean, thanks God for refs.
fo4drmw	1587502603	Patriots	nfl	Not over the Pats
fo4dra3	1587502599	Seahawks	nfl	Outta the way boys, were the only team making big moves today.
fo4drb2	1587502599	Titans	nfl	He was hurt because Adam Gase got him killed week in and week out and Gase probably would have benched Henry because he cant catch. I along with every other fan would much rather be the dolphins with 3 first round picks and massive Cap space then the fucking Jets and whatever the fuck they are doing.
fo4drbd	1587502599	Patriots	nfl	Hes lost almost 3540 lbs from the last one he played. Hes not going to have the same affect blocking.
fo4drkb	1587502602	Patriots	nfl	Edelman and a 3rd are gonna be traded for OJ Howard
fo4drkq	1587502602	Patriots	nfl	Howard AND A 2nd according to some jeez.
fo4drlb	1587502603	49ers	team	Saw Bama a lot. DeVonta Smith and Jeudy were the Best WRs on that offense even jaylen weddle had great games. Ruggs for me its a situational player. Not everything coming from Bama its great...
fo4drxo	1587502607	Patriots	team	People in this sub are very much in their own echo chamber and will ignore any negative or less than stellar news about the Patriots.
fo4dryv	1587502608	Buccaneers	nfl	Fuck it lets trade Evans and Godwin and try to get Kittle and Kelce. 5 TE sets baby
fo4drie	1587502602	Panthers	team	Yeah we are going to get slow roasted by our entire division. Maybe would have had a chance against Atlanta, but we always lose there.
fo4drj4	1587502602	Patriots	nfl	Sanders had a much longer peak (first team all pros every year 19911999), more postseason sucess. And was a great kickpunt returner.It doesnt matter where he lined up he was better than Revis.
fo4drsi	1587502605	Bengals	team	On that front, it was the Tuesday of draft week that it was officially announced that the Colts were definitely taking Andrew Luck...I am FIENDING for such a tweet in the next day or so.
fo4drtf	1587502606	49ers	team	Breida, 5th, 7th?
fo4dryc	1587502607	Patriots	team	Hey, I would never have traded a 2nd round pick for Sanu, draft Michel over Chubb, nor make the offense so bad that it chased away the GOAT QB.
fo4ds18	1587502608	Patriots	team	He came out for Brady, not per se the Bucs I feel.
fo4drir	1587502602	49ers	nfl	George Kittle was a fifthround pick
fo4drjr	1587502602	Ravens	nfl	Bucs are solidified at a top 5 team.  Chiefs  Ravens  Saints  Niners  Bucs  The rest of the league.
fo4drkk	1587502602	Buccaneers	team	All you need is to gronk to run over 3 db for one play like he did in superbowl that year to be worth it.
fo4drlu	1587502603	Buccaneers	team	Not to mention I beat an NFL Memes Facebook page I follow by 10 minutes with this one. A win for the good guys
fo4drvg	1587502606	Patriots	team	1. Tom left in free agency. Are you saying we should have traded him last year?  2. Gronk wasnt even playing for this team and we moved a pick up from 7th to 4th rd for free. 3. Skittles are disgusting.
fo4drvx	1587502606	Patriots	nfl	The Patriots have such a good shot at winning the Super Bowl next year.  Now Im not sure if its the Miami Patriots, the Detroit Patriots, the Tennessee Patriots or Tampa Patriots, but its one of em.
fo4ds8n	1587502612	Patriots	team	BOOOOOO
fo4drsj	1587502605	Chiefs	team	I hope he got transferred to hell
fo4dru6	1587502606	Redskins	nfl	Hell yeah, absolutely agree with you. If it was the Skins doing the same thing Id be fucking ecstatic despite my reservations about teams going all in with old players. Good luck to you guys. Im definitely gonna enjoy seeing how it works out.
fo4drw1	1587502607	Saints	nfl	Yeah, imagine being one of those teams lmfao. How fucking embarrassing would that be?
fo4drz1	1587502608	Cowboys	nfl	Its not the same but we thought the same about witt. That freshness lasted maybe a month and then he declined beyond his 2017 level
fo4ds0l	1587502608	Chiefs	team	I kinda like Jaylon Johnson if hes available at 32
fo4ds3n	1587502610	Vikings	team	I totally agree with your point of view
fo4ds4g	1587502610	Patriots	team	Im just as salty about all this but come on man, they are probably going to make the playoffs and compete. I dont see Brady winning a SB in Tampa, but 88 isnt happening. I also dont think were going to the SB but you never know.
fo4ds4f	1587502610	Buccaneers	team	Because he had no leverage. Gronk coming out of retirement and being on the Pats fucks up our cap space beyond belief. Im shocked we got a 4th for him honestly. The report out there is that BB agreed to a deal with the Lions to trade Gronk before the 2018 season. Gronk basically said I only want to play with Brady and will retire if you make this deal. Im curious to find out more as time goes on about everything behind the scenes that happened with Belichick and TB  Gronk. Sounds like both legends had feet out the door before that 18 season.
fo4ds6q	1587502611	49ers	team	Facts, but it definitely doesnt help that he was an undersized white WR in HS
fo4ds9c	1587502612	Bears	team	UFDA to be named later
fo4dsag	1587502612	Redskins	team	JPs sources are just  HTTR fans on Twitter. He never has the real scoop.  He is a great retweeter though. Got lucky once catching Bruce Allen walk by Dan before he got fired. Julie Donaldson crushes him on the daily.
fo4dsid	1587502615	Patriots	team	Good. Weed them out.
fo4drxd	1587502607	Packers	nfl	Not with spectators, but with a good system for testing (which they have all summer to come up with), they could easily still have games in front of empty stadiums and just test all the players often. It may not be as good as normal, but from a league profit standpoint and a spectator standpoint its far preferable to not playing the season.
fo4ds7n	1587502611	Ravens	nfl	So Lamar wanting to have arguably the best receiver the last 5 or so years is dumb? Yes, his off the field shit is horrible, but Lamar wanting AB talent with Hollywood isnt
fo4dshm	1587502615	Bears	team	A fourth rounder? Hell no! A couple sevenths, tops.
fo4dseu	1587502614	49ers	team	We gonna need some more offense this season to make it back.
fo4dsm1	1587502617	Patriots	team	Yeah exactly.

fo4dstc	1587502620	Jets	team	suspend him for the season, even if its likely cancelled anyway
fo4dsvh	1587502620	Redskins	nfl	GOOD BOY
fo4dsxu	1587502621	Packers	team	Got in a physical altercation at Florida that got him dismissed from the team, played a year as a backup at Miami, took a year of from Miami for personal reasons, rocked shit when he came back!
fo4dt54	1587502624	Broncos	nfl	look at my cock pipe
fo4dt7p	1587502625	Seahawks	nfl	Good points. The money their top two receivers are and will be getting probably make it unrealistic, but still fun to imagine.Though their defense is cheap talent just about everywhere but Lavonte David and Barrett so they probably can afford it if they want to.
fo4dsr2	1587502619	Buccaneers	team	This .... this is amazing
fo4dsro	1587502619	Saints	nfl	Im straight up not having a good time.
fo4dt1i	1587502622	Ravens	nfl	Thats fair. I dont actually want AB. Cost too much, drama is dumb. But lets not pretend like he wouldnt be a positive addition to the offense in terms of what he brings to the game. I doubt it actually happens. Plus I love Hollywood Brown more. I wish I wasnt poor because I want a Lamar Jersey and a Brown Jersey. (Marquise.)
fo4dt26	1587502623	Patriots	team	I imagine hell play at least a bit in every game, the ceiling would be 50 catches 500yards and 5 TDs if I had to guess a range.
fo4dtgq	1587502628	Seahawks	nfl	why does the NFL even bother with stop watch measurements? inaccurate times are worse than no time at allits not like they dont have the technology for fully automatic timing anyways
fo4dsxe	1587502621	Bills	nfl	Because Alex Smith is one of the most forgettable players to ever lace em up. Hes a good QB, but he has zero flash, never did anything super memorable, and his most notable attribute is that he was injured. I bet most people dont even remember how he got injured at this point.
fo4dt18	1587502622	Saints	nfl	Okay guys Tampa is really good but lets not forget how good the saints are Drew BreesAlvin Kamara Michael Thomas Emmanuel Sanders Jared CookJosh HillTaysom HillLike I think both teams are probably making the playoffs with a 124 record
fo4dt3e	1587502623	Lions	nfl	Howards got loads of potential still but hes so inconsistent idk if hes actually an upgrade. Itd be worth it depending on his price I suppose.
fo4dt6l	1587502624	Cowboys	nfl	He was also a very solid punt returner.
fo4dtgf	1587502628	Cowboys	nfl	..but what about Leon Sandcastle?
fo4dtgo	1587502628	Giants	team	Vacchiano, Ranaan, and Traina all said this days ago, so isnt really breaking.
fo4dtlr	1587502630	Rams	team	Looking back at it this  would be one hell of an expensive team considering the CB position itself
fo4dtdq	1587502627	Patriots	nfl	I was hoping for a 5th at least. Him  a 7th for a 4th is great! Im hoping we get 117 instead of 139 but either way, honestly. More ammo to move up into the 2nd.
fo4dtel	1587502628	Patriots	team	Oh jeez.You think Brady is going to struggle throwing it to Mike fucking Evans? Dont be retarded. He struggled last year because our WRs are bums other than Edelman. Just like he struggled with Moss in 07 right, since he had no experience with Brady beforehand?Youre embarrassing yourself. Take off the homer goggles.
fo4dti1	1587502629	Buccaneers	team	If you read 2020 in reverse, its 0202. I have no idea what that means, but this year has been a rocking ride.
fo4dtne	1587502631	Rams	nfl	Id say youre a salty fan of Bradys ex team but those are still just facts.
fo4dtqd	1587502632	Bears	nfl	Was that with Moss when Welker was playing? Was it ever Moss, Gronk, Hernandez, and Welker andor Edelman?
fo4dtvt	1587502634	Patriots	nfl	Not to mention the offensive line was really good.  Not in the biggest game of their lives but outside of that.
fo4dtwq	1587502634	Patriots	team	A lot of the greatest TEs in the league were essentially big wide receivers.
fo4dtp7	1587502631	Patriots	nfl	I want Gronk to have more ammo for best TE ever. Im happy to see him play.
fo4du6e	1587502638	Saints	nfl	yawn
fo4dtxy	1587502635	Packers	nfl	They also paid a 7th though.
fo4du1n	1587502637	Colts	team	Any dont you like him?
fo4dufw	1587502642	Bills	team	OJ Hold my beer, watch this.  Its the Bills, sure he could.
fo4dukk	1587502644	Falcons	nfl	Does that mean Sammy Watkins is an amazing receiver now?
fo4du37	1587502637	Buccaneers	team	If I had to guess I would say we trade OJ. There were already rumors we were shopping him.
fo4du5g	1587502638	Patriots	team	No no no I cant I just got my new Brady and gronk jerseys. Im gonna go cry.
fo4du5k	1587502638	Bengals	team	Realistically theres a chance for everything theres a chance they take, Herbert, tua, etc, etc. I mean Id honestly love to see them not, Im not particularly sold on burrow, but Id simply want to see them do it to see how drastically it would shake up literally everyones draft plans.
fo4du6j	1587502638	Bears	team	Depends on where you want to take him. I refuse to take him in the second but I wouldnt mind trading back.I just think theres so much WR, OL, and CB talent  that will be available with those early picks, and wed benefit more from that.Again, I do want a QB in this draft, for the same situation you stated. I think we just value Hurts differently.
fo4ducn	1587502640	Eagles	team	Yall seem to forget he was Bood like week 1 in 2018
fo4duge	1587502642	Bills	team	At the very least, the Cheaters only got a 4th. But they can use that 4th to move up even more in the first round. And hes out of the division and conference. Hopefully, we will get to play that fuck this season. I harbor no ill will against the Buccs as an organization. But the fact that Brady got his favorite toy back and it went so seamlessly. Just once, I want somebody to fleece Belicheat.No more fucking woe is me, my back hurts, oh, I get hammered everytime I have the ball and the refs look the other way bullshit from Gronk and his fans. He came back, I dont want to see ESPN waxing poetically how admirably and brave Gronk is for coming back and playing so hard. Fuck that ass hole. Fuck, I thought we were rid of this douchebag.
fo4dujp	1587502643	Browns	team	Dont get why everyone is so willing for the Browns to get rid of guys. Id rather have proven talent instead of rolling the dice on a rookie. Weve sucked for 20 years. We need all the talent that we can get. Im sick of losing.
fo4duwc	1587502648	Eagles	team	Also. Chase Utley
fo4duyx	1587502649	Patriots	team	Probably trading one of Brate or HowardOr just have 3 good TE
fo4dur5	1587502646	Giants	team	I remember watching OJ drop closer and closer to us at 23 in that draft and BEGGING the Giants to trade up for him. He was such a threat in the pass game and a great blocker. I know he hasnt panned out thus far with the Bucs but Id still love to get him somehow.
fo4durg	1587502646	49ers	nfl	I played against a fucking shit ton of Ravens when 20 first came out and I just took over QB spy on defense and that was all you really needed to do since dick heads would only spam Lamar runs. One dude won a big Madden tournament with just spamming Lamar
fo4duts	1587502647	49ers	nfl	Niners want him bad. Juedy bombed the Wonderlic, and the Niners appear to be scared of that since Rueben Foster.
fo4duxo	1587502649	Redskins	team	Gronk definitely has some stipulations that lower his value, but so does Trent. A laundry list of injuries, a desire for a monster contract, him wanting to leave DCRon wanting to establish a culture. My point is, players dont have the trade value that posters in this sub think. Hell, during the season it was speculated NE offered us a 1 for Trent and people here said no because its going to be pick 32, practically a 2nd rounder.
fo4duxz	1587502649	Jets	nfl	There it is! Thats pretty much what Im saying. I just think theyre too modern of a look. Our old unis were so classic. Wouldve preferred a modern take on a classic look.
fo4dv04	1587502650	Buccaneers	team	Without a doubt one of the best off seasons for a team Ive ever seen
fo4dva0	1587502654	Vikings	nfl	I mean really all they needed last year to make a playoff run was a decent QB.
fo4dva6	1587502654	Falcons	nfl	He lost a bunch of weight by changing his diet and work out routine. Hes probably in great shape but not as big.
fo4duvr	1587502648	Patriots	team	Yeah definitely got great, the secondary is a issue. A step down from the Pats but there is enough there to be decent.
fo4dv4r	1587502652	Giants	nfl	We are all aware and scared.
fo4dvie	1587502657	49ers	nfl	Pretty sure all wed need to see next is Edelman considering retirement if not traded to Bucs for there to be mass suicides in Boston.
fo4dvkj	1587502658	Bears	team	Yes
fo4dvnq	1587502659	Redskins	nfl	Tbh Id take a 5th. If they wont, Id rather just take Trent into the draft and see what happens.
fo4dv53	1587502652	Vikings	team	As a person who follows badgers football living in Wisconsin (not a die hard fan) never draft a Wisconsin rb. WI pounds the rock so numbers are inflated. Also Wi generally has one of the best offensive run blocking lines in all of football.
fo4dv81	1587502653	Jets	team	Its like fucking groundhog day....
fo4dv9n	1587502654	Patriots	team	Can we just cancel this season?
fo4dvcu	1587502655	Packers	nfl	Ravens traded their TE 3 though
fo4dvef	1587502656	Giants	nfl	 Theres no precedent for a suspension due to civil mattersSure but the assualt charge is not a civil matter.  Hes had a number of run ins with the law.  While most have not resulted in actual charges, that hasnt stopped the league in the past.  Also Cognito got his a 4 game suspension for his actions while not on a roster.
fo4dvfq	1587502656	Browns	nfl	Who hurt you
fo4dvok	1587502659	Patriots	nfl	Theres still a lot of question marks with him but regardless the Buccaneers organization will be enjoying considerably higher TV ratings this season
fo4dvce	1587502655	Texans	nfl	If youre heated about Gronk to Tampa Bay, just remember our GM gave away a top 3 WR for metaphorical peanuts.
fo4dvgo	1587502656	Patriots	team	Lol Pats will struggle to GET to 88 this year. Whether Brady stayed or not
fo4dvx0	1587502662	Dolphins	nfl	Dolphins, Rockets, and Blue Jays here. We must be natural enemies.
fo4dvx6	1587502663	Jets	nfl	Excuse me...what the fuck
fo4dw1j	1587502664	Buccaneers	team	Wtf are they thinking?!?!??!! Im totally against this trade!!! We already have 2 good TEs. We dont need Gronk!!!! We couldve spent that money elsewhere. 10 million for a player that plays a position that we have a surplus of?!?!?!?! I will be so glad when they fire Licht!!!!!!
fo4dw5j	1587502666	Cowboys	nfl	I also agree there. Im just saying there are a ton of variables and we really have no idea and wont till games are played. I do think the Bucs are shaping up to be a very interesting team and think they have a much better chance than not to be good.
fo4dvj8	1587502657	Colts	nfl	Vince Young has entered the chatAnyone know how Tampas oline is? Cause Arians loves to push the ball downfield
fo4dw8w	1587502667	Chiefs	nfl	Some shady stuff is happening in NE. We know there was beef with Brady and BB and Kraft. We know Gronk was almost traded but said he wouldnt play with any QB other than Brady. Then he retired, and as soon as Brady left NE he came back to play with Brady. Sounds to me like he wanted to play with Brady, but not in NE. Makes you wonder whats going on behind those doors.
fo4dw96	1587502667	Packers	team	I think itd surprise some considering the investment thats already been made in the secondary. But I mentioned it as my pick, so its not gonna blow me away either lol
fo4dvzv	1587502664	Patriots	nfl	Hmm actually bye hangs up on tampa
fo4dw6p	1587502666	Redskins	nfl	They gutted the 247 division already, and now this.  Former champs dropping like flies.
fo4dwc7	1587502668	Giants	nfl	I have to imagine he wasnt coming back to the Pats under any circumstances so any return is better than nothing
fo4dwmc	1587502672	Browns	nfl	Im in this comment every season.

fo4dwd5	1587502669	Colts	nfl	Yeah Im pretty upset at how well this is all working out for Pats fans... still get to see Brady and Gronk and not in the AFC, get to watch the mastermind BB take on the league without his apprentice, a new challenge. The rich just get richer. That said I hope the Bucs and Pats both finish with less than 4 wins this year so you ducks can know SOME pain. But I dont see that happening
fo4dwi9	1587502671	Buccaneers	nfl	nando would be looked at as potential hof if he wasnt a complete psychopath tbh
fo4dwmn	1587502673	Eagles	team	I dont wanna kill the hype but drafting him in the first is a pass for me
fo4dwp7	1587502674	Redskins	team	Why would we give up more? Id want a late pick from then for Trent
fo4dwqq	1587502674	Eagles	nfl	Wait arent most of the Buccaneers dream team components receivers 
fo4dwt2	1587502675	Patriots	nfl	Pretty sure Brady wants AB and Arians would bend on it.
fo4dwv2	1587502676	Giants	nfl	I think Regis would definitely clock the ballcarrier, did you see what he did to that mailbox?
fo4dw9w	1587502667	Steelers	team	 Needs more Offensive Linemen.
fo4dwc5	1587502668	Bills	nfl	Dude, the stats show that he wasnt top 10, idk what to ducking tell you, most of the guys on that lists didnt play 16 games and again, HE WAS 12 IN TARGETS WHICH SHOWS HE WAS STILL USED A LOT. At BEST he was 10th best TE that year. Sorry that you were fucking wrong and just cant accept that, but you are. Please provide me SOME evidence that he was top 10 other than you saying lol yes he was
fo4dwdo	1587502669	49ers	team	Hes not really a sleeper after the combine.
fo4dwdr	1587502669	Buccaneers	team	Yeah I just saw that Boston Globe says they traded Gronks retirement contract for a 4th round draft pick. Im excited to see if it works out
fo4dwhn	1587502671	Ravens	nfl	Break curses like we break records
fo4dwn6	1587502673	Saints	team	Gronk washed as fuck and Tom
fo4dwuq	1587502676	Buccaneers	team	Fuck no!!!!
fo4dx0c	1587502678	Patriots	team	A 4th is maybe like a 10 bill. Cool but also not that great.
fo4dx35	1587502679	Patriots	team	Close games? No way that would be the biggest waste of a roster spot. Gronk is going to play
fo4dwhs	1587502671	Packers	team	My mistake, I didnt intend to say you. It was supposed to be more generic to the fan base, should have been our. I effd it up
fo4dwtl	1587502675	Patriots	team	yeah thats what he said
fo4dx57	1587502679	Redskins	team	Williams and a 4th for Howard and Donovan Smith? Is that doable? Im lazy
fo4dx5q	1587502680	Bears	nfl	They could and thats fine. Im just saying I think people are overrating their ability and values at this stage of their careers. I still think the Saints are a far better team right now
fo4dx7z	1587502680	Seahawks	nfl	He literally said Gronk was 6th in yards after playing less games than everyone, didnt mention at all his blocking and brought up his TDs as if it was more important than that. Its so clear to me.
fo4dx9n	1587502681	Eagles	nfl	The joke was ice cubes in a beer. The real joke is Alshon steep decline.
fo4dxao	1587502682	Saints	nfl	hot take they still dont make the playoffs.
fo4dwr5	1587502674	Buccaneers	team	Please let there be a 2020 seasonPlease let there be a 2020 seasonPlease let there be a 2020 seasonPlease let there be a 2020 season
fo4dwsd	1587502675	Patriots	team	I dont Gronk is signing anything if we dont trade him, he has no interest in being a Patriot. Gronk had no leverage over us
fo4dwtz	1587502675	Buccaneers	team	Come on down juelz
fo4dwu4	1587502675	Browns	team	Full Berry doesnt have the same ring to it, but it would apply if this came off.
fo4dww6	1587502676	Lions	team	Trade for Thuney and dont reach for a Guard unless you have the chance to draft Ruiz or Cushenberry at proper value. Ironically, either of those two being drafted by the Patriots is what will lead Thuney to us. Sign Logan Ryan after we pass on Okudah.
fo4dwzn	1587502677	Patriots	team	I thought it was the Dolphins.
fo4dx00	1587502677	Bills	nfl	lmao what the fuck
fo4dx1l	1587502678	Patriots	team	im not sad because hes being traded, im sad because im worried this means that players hate playing for bill. and I dont want that because it casts a pall upon everything.
fo4dx3y	1587502679	Bears	team	Not to mention most mock drafts have Hurts as a third rounder or worse
fo4dxec	1587502683	Patriots	nfl	I get it though. Im the first person to ever say think about yourself, everyone else will use you otherwise.Actually more mad at Gronk. Tease us about coming back just to get traded within 45 minutes if a Schefter bomb. Actually fuck that.
fo4dx13	1587502678	Raiders	nfl	Fabian Washington was the most Al Davis pick ever.
fo4dxr2	1587502688	Redskins	nfl	At Dawn, look to the NFC East
fo4dxkq	1587502685	Eagles	nfl	Classic narcissist.
fo4dxpy	1587502687	Patriots	team	I noticed it yesterday after his Jordan post, Tom still follows and likes his posts so who knows. Could just be Edelman fucking with us
fo4dy2s	1587502692	Buccaneers	nfl	all these old northerners are going south to florida!
fo4dxjm	1587502685	Seahawks	nfl	really its the Rams that should be pissed because they went from Winstonnot gronk to BradyGronk plus already having to play against the Patriots this year.
fo4dxkg	1587502685	Packers	nfl	It was kind of an 11 on 1 sort of deal. Thats how good Sanders was.
fo4dxl2	1587502685	Patriots	team	I think the Bills probably will win it this year. They had 10 wins last year and I highly doubt we can get to double digit wins
fo4dxmd	1587502685	Vikings	nfl	TBF youre relying on post40 year old Brady who declined last year, and well, most of your dream team components being receivers. Your defense and offensive lines are still subpar on paper, you dont really have a running back either...
fo4dxmx	1587502686	Patriots	nfl	Brady was the puppet master all along...
fo4dxsx	1587502688	Patriots	team	Brady left because of the last 3 seasons, not because of a timeline. He could have played the next 2 seasons in NE if he wasnt treated like they wanted him gone. Brady is not a patriot because Bill hasnt wanted him in 3 years and no amount of rings or wins or dedication by Tom was going to change that, which he finally accepted and moved on.
fo4dy17	1587502692	Colts	team	Sports center fwiw
fo4dxql	1587502687	Patriots	team	Ah were doing the Danny Ainge defense for Bill. Got it. Everyones so frightened of him and thats why he cant make any decent trades.
fo4dxzv	1587502691	49ers	nfl	Idk about Ty, just because of how ridiculous Revis prime was, but Champ I def agree
fo4dy04	1587502691	Raiders	team	honestly they probably have already spoken to him behind closed doors.
fo4dy5w	1587502693	Buccaneers	team	I believe the standard is 3 years after his first lap dance.
fo4dybs	1587502695	Patriots	team	This offseason in a nutshell lol.
fo4dy3a	1587502692	Titans	nfl	Dude drives at 105mph with no seat belt while recording video. His decision making is what it is and is what it will be. I dont expect his career to be very long despite the MVP award. Hed be in cognitive company with that AB.
fo4dyjb	1587502698	49ers	nfl	That will be beautiful
fo4dxvc	1587502689	Falcons	nfl	Obviously you never want a guy to get hurt but you know that dude has been turbo partying lol. I think they wouldve done better than a 4th rounder if he was really ready to go
fo4dy2l	1587502692	Buccaneers	nfl	thats what Ive been discovering since this news broke. I will be much more happy with this trade if we get some good value for Howard
fo4dygq	1587502697	Browns	team	Its more realistic imo, hypothetical speaking.
fo4dyix	1587502698	Bills	team	beer slips out of hand handing it to you
fo4dynb	1587502700	Saints	nfl	Belichick doesnt play QB and wasnt this successful before Brady came along.
fo4dy5p	1587502693	Raiders	team	TNF opening week is actually a reward1) Youre coming off the last preseason game where your starters didnt play so theres no short prep week.2) This also means to TNF the rest of the year so no short weeks at all this season.3) gives you an extended prep for week 2.
fo4dy6x	1587502694	Patriots	nfl	I agree, only logical solution to this is to suspend Tom Brady for 4 games for being generally aware of Gronks mood and to award the Pats the Bucs first rounders from 20202030
fo4dy8q	1587502694	Bengals	team	Literally every single Bengals reporter is confidently saying theyre going to take Burrow. I feel like theyve all had some off the record conversations with the decision makers and I cant wait to hear about it. I know its the Bengals and its easy to say, LOL Mike Brown tho, but Ill be shocked more than Ive ever been shocked if Joe Burrow is not a Cincinnati Bengal come Friday morning
fo4dya8	1587502695	Jets	team	Thursday night couldnt come soon enough
fo4dybq	1587502695	Raiders	team	Ruggs might be there at 19. Zero chance Chase Young makes it past 3
fo4dydx	1587502696	Chiefs	nfl	Hes literally just trying to get free advertising for his cbd company.
fo4dyfw	1587502697	Patriots	team	Foxborough forever.
fo4dyrh	1587502701	Colts	nfl	Sucks, I like Hooker, he just needs to get someconsistency.
fo4dyfg	1587502697	Patriots	team	So what does this do to the cap space?
fo4dyh3	1587502697	Lions	nfl	Remember, the State you live in is simultaneously the worst state ever, but yet, also the best one too
fo4dyop	1587502700	Browns	team	Id rather keep Hunt

fo4dyou	1587502700	Seahawks	nfl	They should have been a playoff team last year and had Winston not thrown 50 INTs, they would have.  They should have won the games against the Texans, Seahawks, Titans, Giants and sweeping the Falcons.  The upgrade with Brady will make them a pencil in for at least the division title.
fo4dyvn	1587502703	Patriots	nfl	Sorry to the fake fan downvoting my comment but if you want to discuss your opinion, how about replying so we can discuss. Choose not to be offended by other peoples words and life will be much better for you.
fo4dyxz	1587502703	Buccaneers	nfl	Ive never followed a team that people want to play for before. I dont know what to do with my hands.
fo4dyzg	1587502704	Dolphins	team	We can put him At guard
fo4dzhk	1587502711	Chargers	team	Are the navy helmets going to just switch out the facemasks and bolt sticker or are they going to be completely new helmets?
fo4dytr	1587502702	Buccaneers	nfl	Please stop.  I can only get so erect
fo4dyyl	1587502704	Buccaneers	nfl	idk why ur acting like i said gronks gonna be the player to take us to the next level bro
fo4dznk	1587502713	Patriots	team	He killed my fantasy team last year so
fo4dz2t	1587502705	Eagles	team	And Im not saying that we shouldnt upgrade at the slot position. Im saying that its an easier need to fill. On top of that, Agholors success was dependent on having two other outside WRs demanding attention and freeing up the areas in which he and Ertz normally worked. Jefferson will be working the same area with another mouth to feed.The other consideration is that its not a certainty that hes going to be a stud in the slot. No player is guaranteed to be a slam dunk and, while I can understand going for the best player available there, overlooking his fit when we have two great TEs for two more years would be foolish. Also, why would we be taking an outside WR later? If were not taking Jefferson at WR, theres still a very real chance we still take a WR that fits the mold of an outside WR.As for your slot comparison, most of the slot WRs that youre talking about (save Thielen and Kupp) found success on the outside before moving into the slot and played almost entirely in that position in college and were projected as outside WR. Adams, Allen, Thomas, Hopkins all found success on the outside in college and then in the NFL. Jefferson still didnt do all that well in college on the outside and serious had issues with press coverage. He didnt face it often, but he handled it poorly when there.
fo4dz42	1587502706	Seahawks	team	Awesome news!  Hope we keep Luke forever
fo4dz7b	1587502707	Patriots	team	Am I the only one who thinks a fourth rounder is too low? I thought theyd push for Oj Howard at the least.
fo4dz8r	1587502708	49ers	nfl	Dude we gave you guys Montana and Smith. Well take Mahomes off your hands when youre done with him in like a year or maybe a month.
fo4dzmg	1587502713	Browns	nfl	I already ordered but I was actually thinking about that but didnt see the option
fo4dzne	1587502713	Chiefs	team	Me too, he was unfortunately gone. SF picked him at 31.
fo4dzpg	1587502714	Broncos	nfl	People will put up with a lot when youre winning
fo4dzpo	1587502714	Saints	nfl	Also you dont keep 3 TEs when you have WRs like that lol. The Ravens did it well because their WRs are mediocre at best
fo4dzcr	1587502709	Vikings	team	We will not get a haul at all for Dalvin.
fo4dzmy	1587502713	Bears	team	Are you just going to each post and commenting this? I think this is the third time Ive seen u post this same thing. Go away troll. Go find a therapist
fo4dzv4	1587502716	49ers	nfl	Thanks, I needed this right now (
fo4dzyb	1587502717	Patriots	team	I feel the same way.  Fuck Tampa, they dont deserve any of this.
fo4e03e	1587502719	Patriots	team	Im not making this up, you cant mane this up and god i hate coincidences.I just went to pick up some food, and in window of the place there was a newspaper pasted upside with an article about Gronk and Brady, i think it was about the SB against rams.
fo4dzqt	1587502715	Packers	team	no thread
fo4dzt5	1587502715	Giants	nfl	Been noticing more Buccaneer fans here and a lot less pats. Wonder why 
fo4dzz0	1587502718	Texans	team	You mean support my team no matter? Crazy concept.
fo4e0bl	1587502722	Colts	nfl	MXC instead of ARI
fo4dzxf	1587502717	Redskins	team	Id throw that comp 4th at them real quick.
fo4e01v	1587502719	Redskins	team	Tent and a 4th for Howard and Donovan Smith? Is that doable?
fo4e06s	1587502720	Buccaneers	team	But then the McCourty signing is a bit odd to me. Thuney is getting traded this week too I think.
fo4e09c	1587502721	Colts	nfl	The Brady circlejerk will die a few weeks into the season
fo4e0fh	1587502724	Patriots	team	Lol thats wildly incorrect, but alright.
fo4e0j9	1587502725	Buccaneers	nfl	Preaching to the choir. Go look at my history on Winston. I was so looking forward to this year with him (the magical 2nd year under Arians). Even if he cuts the INTs down a ton, I dont think itll be anywhere near what Brady does. A good Winston is 15 INTs...a Good Brady is 7.
fo4e027	1587502719	Patriots	team	The rumour going around is that the patriots are going to trade Joe Thuney. That would create a lot of space. Plus the patriots only need 1.97 million for Oj Howard. If not then draft a tight end. But the patriots cannot go into the season with Matt Lacosse and Ryan Izzo.
fo4e0c7	1587502722	Vikings	team	How is that facts lol we needed a last second miracle play
fo4e0ef	1587502723	Raiders	nfl	Offensive line on that 2007 team was probably a lot better than this Bucs team given how Bucs fans talk about the current line, but the skill positions definitely could be better than that team
fo4e0f2	1587502724	Jets	nfl	I agree, I like the green helmet, although I wish it wasnt chrome. And then, as Ive mentioned, the logo... And youre right, the words above the numbers dont look great.
fo4e0gg	1587502724	Patriots	nfl	Yeah I agree.
fo4e0gz	1587502724	Giants	nfl	He looks like hes in just fine shape.(httpswww.thesun.co.ukwpcontentuploads201802nintchdbpict000313448605.jpg)Give him another 4 to train before OTAs, hell be good to go.
fo4e0s9	1587502729	Chiefs	team	Those bastards
fo4e0tk	1587502729	Patriots	nfl	Good work lol
fo4e080	1587502721	Packers	team	In the last hour? If its happening, its in the works right now
fo4e081	1587502721	Eagles	team	Murray and Aiyuk would be  acceptable.
fo4e0eu	1587502724	Panthers	nfl	Probably means piece vs pawn, wherein chess lingo the term piece is colloquially used to refers to bishops, rooks, and knights, which have more versatile movement patterns than pawns
fo4e0ex	1587502724	Lions	nfl	!RemindMe 8 months
fo4e0fs	1587502724	Steelers	nfl	Hes a deadly TE
fo4e0fw	1587502724	Bills	nfl	No, its okay, the odds of us having to play them again without making a Super Bowl are very low. Im cool with this.
fo4e0qd	1587502728	Packers	nfl	Thats so wrong. The moment he files his paperwork you guys need to make a move by releasing someone so either Thuney gets cut and the locker room hates it because Gronk stays and a current player got shafted or the guy that wasnt in your plans gets traded away or cut for no value.
fo4e0si	1587502729	Ravens	nfl	Bears will now be trotting him out
fo4e0uy	1587502730	Patriots	team	Could be worse, could be on the fins
fo4e10n	1587502732	Titans	team	WR is a bigger need than people want to talk about (we have one legitimate outside receiver on this roster) but I agree this is pretty laughable.
fo4e0hh	1587502725	Raiders	team	we just need to come out of the draft with one of these WRs ruggs,lamb,jeudy,J.jefferson,mims or higgins. only guys worth a first. if not those guys, we got to grab guys in the 3rd, antonio gibson, van jefferson, Gabriel davis, devin duvernay, brandon aiyuk,kj hambler,claypool.. out of the whole draft if we add any of these names i will be happy at WR. based on needs, we grabbing WR and corner in the first. I wont be mad losing a pick to move up for only two players that is Simmons and Okudah nobody else is worth it.
fo4e11a	1587502732	Lions	nfl	Wins. He may not have gaudy stats, but hes shown he has what it takes to win games.
fo4e14z	1587502734	Chiefs	nfl	Until Mahomes, I dont think the Chiefs had won a game at Heinz field since like 1990 or something like that
fo4e0wg	1587502730	Chargers	team	Id assume its at Sofi Stadium. Which isnt open yet.
fo4e1ab	1587502736	Ravens	nfl	Putting on weight trening hard, eating clean anavar giving up!
fo4e1aj	1587502736	Steelers	team	I heard the same thing. But I wouldnt hate throwing a conditional 7th for him, why not?
fo4e1eb	1587502737	Vikings	team	Source?
fo4e1k8	1587502740	Jets	nfl	httpswww.instagram.compBQZ9UBBEB?igshid1p8jfvnmlb7riYall are quick
fo4e1l0	1587502740	Redskins	team	So, youre saying that hes not a weapon with the stats he has despite NOT having a HOF QB tossing him the ball.Seems that makes his production even more significant.Sounds like hes a gun thats doing more than 90 of the others while being given fewer bullets. )
fo4e17m	1587502735	Buccaneers	nfl	Cant wait to drink a beer w Gronk in Ybor
fo4e1b5	1587502736	Bears	nfl	Bravo sir. I forgot about this comment. I see youve been waiting for vengeance! Lol
fo4e1bv	1587502737	Chargers	nfl	If Reddit is good at one thing its fucking meming on the spot
fo4e1m9	1587502740	Patriots	team	the good news is that this season wont be played as long as corona is wreaking havoc on the world so weve got that going for us
fo4e1kg	1587502740	Lions	team	To be sure, I certainly think Okudah could help the Lions (a fart could help the Lions). I just think help along the line and pass rush are needed more and will also help the secondary (Simmons will help both the secondary and pass rush).  Not too keen on taking Brown at 3 either but would prefer over Okudah (Brown will be more than just a run stuffer). Would have no problem taking Simmons at 3. Hopefully they trade back, get a few extra picks and still get one of the three. Its a crap shoot. You never know. Undrafted players can have goodgreat careers and first rounders can amount to nothing. Okudah should not be the pick at 3 is my opinion and Im sticking to it. If they take him at 3, I hope you can bring this up in a few years and laugh at me for how wrong I was. Hell, maybe theyll take a TE!?
fo4e1x9	1587502745	Patriots	team	Can we throw a slash and a bucs after the name of this sub. Im stuck with Bill the least likable person in New England
fo4e1qx	1587502742	Broncos	team	While I dont disagree with any of your points, 3rd safety is still not a priority. Having Parks was a luxury. And I have made the exact same statement about him being a Swiss Army knife, so I certainly understand his value. We should always be looking to add talent. If we find somebody thats great.Still not a need
fo4e1ua	1587502744	Chargers	team	Or worn in a San Diego stadium (
fo4e26g	1587502748	Bills	nfl	Gronk to Tampa BayMichaelScott.No
fo4e2a8	1587502749	Giants	team	The tweeter has an inside source connected to Steve tisch. He is not reporting what others are saying.
fo4e2aa	1587502749	Falcons	nfl	This is canon for me now.
fo4e1ms	1587502741	Patriots	team	I hope he doesnt ruin his back, I really thought retirement was the best choice, you have the rest of your life man.
fo4e1p4	1587502741	49ers	team	Adding Brady doesnt make the Bucs a Superbowl contender. Dont  me.
fo4e1r7	1587502742	49ers	team	or the kid from bama I refuse to speak his name aloud.
fo4e1tz	1587502744	Jets	team	Chargers traded their starting lt and idk whos their tackles now
fo4e20a	1587502746	Patriots	team	I actually love that grayout one as a color rush option, especially cause it would work home or away against most teams.
fo4e27s	1587502748	Buccaneers	nfl	I think fans always overrate what they think compensation they will get. Patriots all of a sudden have a new 4th for free pretty much, I think thats a good trade for both teams.
fo4e27o	1587502748	Patriots	team	Good. Hope they never come back.
fo4e2ng	1587502755	Buccaneers	team	Most likely hes gone, Im fine with it as long as we get a lot compensation for him.
fo4e2ik	1587502753	Browns	nfl	Gronk is GOAT at his peak, Tony has the GOAT career. Longevity matters.
fo4e2m1	1587502754	Dolphins	team	You mean Sebastian Janikowski right?
fo4e2ly	1587502754	Falcons	nfl	Whos the third?
fo4e2t5	1587502757	Jaguars	nfl	That was prerape allegationvictim threatening
fo4e2bx	1587502750	Patriots	nfl	YES
fo4e2c2	1587502750	Chargers	team	White the powder blue accents on white looks soooo good
fo4e2ij	1587502753	Falcons	team	Corners dont typically cover TEs though... I get people wanting a CB, but I dont think this changes much for that argument. This is just one more reason for us to say a prayer for Keanus health this year.
fo4e2ra	1587502756	Buccaneers	team	httpsi.imgur.comnW0GH2W.jpg
fo4e2s1	1587502756	Patriots	team	Ill personally never root for them again.  Ill always love them and wish them nothing but the best in their personal endeavors.  I hope the Bucs flop and never find success in their tenure.
fo4e2sg	1587502757	Steelers	nfl	And Godwin, who is more of a threat than Gronk imo
fo4e2ld	1587502754	Patriots	team	i mean ive heard of Rutgers so..
fo4e2mi	1587502754	Patriots	nfl	Bucs play you in 2021
fo4e2u7	1587502757	Giants	team	Big if true. In all seriousness, I hope its wills
fo4e2v4	1587502757	Steelers	nfl	
fo4e2pw	1587502755	Patriots	team	LETS GO JUULS THATS THE PATRIOT WAY LETS FUCKING GO
fo4e2u0	1587502757	Falcons	team	Tua is in there and I agree with Brown. Maybe Kinlaw also
fo4e3dd	1587502764	Titans	team	This is a top notch breakdown, thank you.
fo4e3fg	1587502765	Bears	nfl	Holy shit. What universe do we live in.
fo4e3lk	1587502767	Broncos	team	Good thing the Falcons and Panthers will probably suck.
fo4e3b0	1587502764	Lions	team	Simmons at 6
fo4e3b8	1587502764	Broncos	nfl	Dont forget Devin Hester, I mean he wasnt a great WR but he was great and technically a WR
fo4e3bu	1587502764	Eagles	team	BDN can beat us in the NFC Championship game and I will still cheer this man during that game and forever.
fo4e3ed	1587502765	Patriots	nfl	No they wouldnt lol. Gronk wasnt coming back to play for us, and neither was Brady. I literally already watched them win 6 in my life. More than your entire franchise has even been to in its history. I think Ill live.
fo4e3fu	1587502765	Packers	nfl	First was better, but the second wasnt too shabby. A high school date night is where my memory stems from. Ill have to watch em both again tonight just to be sure.
fo4e3gy	1587502766	Bills	nfl	Connecting flight out of new york or toronto. And among the things on draftjoshallen.com is a LaGuardia airport review.
fo4e3nd	1587502768	Ravens	nfl	If thePats still so,whos stumble into the playoffs after all this turnover, then there really is no God.
fo4e3yp	1587502773	Broncos	nfl	The rich will get richer, and the little that the poor has, shall be taken awayGuess who said it effing GOD!  It is in the Christian holy book.
fo4e3j1	1587502767	Patriots	team	The rumour going around is that the patriots are going to trade Joe Thuney. That would create a lot of space. Plus the patriots only need 1.97 million for Oj Howard. If not then draft a tight end. But the patriots cannot go into the season with Matt Lacosse and Ryan Izzo.
fo4e3of	1587502768	Patriots	team	Because theyre getting set up with great field position when a QB turns the ball over multiple times a game..
fo4e3vk	1587502771	Patriots	nfl	Yeah but gronk had no desire to play for New England. In this scenario he would have to
fo4e46x	1587502776	Browns	nfl	Kim Jung Un could be dying as well
fo4e47j	1587502776	Jets	nfl	I mean Ryan Tannehill definitely dealt with injuries before Gase, idk what Jets fan hurt you, have a nice rest of your day
fo4e3qe	1587502769	Patriots	nfl	No, but I was a Pats fan before Brady so Im not stopping now lol.
fo4e3tk	1587502770	Patriots	team	Gronk with a year to heal should still be dominant, but I dont think hes coming out of retirement to block.  I think hell be more of a situational player where if theyre in the red zone or need to convert a key 3rd down hell come out.  I think hell have elite TD numbers but relatively low yardage and receptions.
fo4e3vx	1587502772	Vikings	nfl	Yeah its been a whole two years since terrible, ancient Tom Brady won it all with a worse set of skill position players lol
fo4e400	1587502773	49ers	nfl	I think hes only appeared in a handful of events (like 23 ever), he was a host for some of them though. Hell he was appearing in shit like WrestleMania in 2017 lol he can do it.
fo4e41d	1587502774	Lions	nfl	I rather not go then have your luck 
fo4e42s	1587502774	Bears	team	Disgusting
fo4e45c	1587502775	Panthers	nfl	We used to play the Pats pretty well. But now without Kuechly... also the Pats never had Evans and Godwin. Yea this sucks.
fo4e47g	1587502776	Jets	team	Lol the media is stoopid. Telling me no NFL player wants to get paid millions of dollars in the greatest city on the planet? Fuck outta here.
fo4e4b5	1587502778	Cardinals	nfl	TBF he was probably only willing to come back if he could play with Brady....So NE new they would rather get at least something for him.
fo4e4it	1587502780	Patriots	team	Aaaand there was desire from fans to bring the 90s back, which was also silver.... Right? Sooo makes sense to me
fo4e4tp	1587502784	Texans	nfl	Excuse me, what the fuck?
fo4e4cx	1587502778	Jets	team	If they didnt need a QB Id have def placed them there as well. I just dont see them passing up on Tua or Herbert.
fo4e4ja	1587502781	Giants	nfl	Only Eli Manning could stop Tom Brady. But when the NFL needed him the most. He retired.
fo4e4wa	1587502786	Seahawks	nfl	eh im pretty happy to have left NC for WA.
fo4e4yf	1587502786	Patriots	nfl	Gronk has the WWE Belt tho to back it up
fo4e4qy	1587502783	Redskins	team	I think the salarys would match up enough but I would do Trent for OJ and Smith straight up since they are getting best player in deal and dont need OJ
fo4e53a	1587502788	Colts	nfl	I dont believe that this is happening.
fo4e57i	1587502790	Redskins	team	I think it would just take a fourth. They should be sending us a pick in this scenario.  A 4th for OJ. Trent to someone else.
fo4e5ab	1587502791	Patriots	team	See how you said, throwing to mike Evans, and didnt name a single other wr, then said his only options last year was Edelman. He had meyers, harry and all of our HB last year here and couldnt make it work. All Ive seen is people bring up 3 names so far, Evans brate and gronk. Brady didnt have a raging ego in 07 thats why moss worked.
fo4e505	1587502787	Buccaneers	team	For real!!!!! Wtf do we need hurt busted ass Gronk? We already have good TEs. This a stupid fucking move.
fo4e57q	1587502790	Patriots	team	And lets remember eating a w.....he put that defense out to dry throwing a shit ton of ints that aint gonna happen now so
fo4e4xl	1587502786	Bills	nfl	This is not primeGronk. PrimeGronk and PrimeHernandez were unreal. That was a murders row.
fo4e5by	1587502791	Patriots	team	2020 needs to just pull over and let me the fuck out. Ill walk bro (
fo4e5eo	1587502792	Raiders	nfl	Am I a joke to you?Tyrell Pryor
fo4e5ko	1587502795	Chargers	team	That shit vanished within minutes
fo4e5ln	1587502795	Raiders	team	Go on
fo4e584	1587502790	Buccaneers	team	Id say the wide receivers and front seven. The secondary improved but they still struggled.
fo4e5ee	1587502792	Bears	team	This is called Belichicking.
fo4e5f3	1587502793	49ers	team	No offense to anyone here but what has Trent Taylor done to get such high praise here???
fo4e5k9	1587502795	Bears	nfl	Exactly, my main points with this are that Gronk will most likely get hurt at some point (even if not hes probably not athletic enough at this point to be worth 10mil) and the Bucs still need oline help which everybody is ignoring. Jameis could avoid pressure a lot better than Brady at this point. If they dont hit on their oline picks at this point, they are screwed
fo4e5vv	1587502799	Steelers	nfl	Good point!
fo4e5r2	1587502798	Patriots	team	Too soon!
fo4e5kc	1587502795	49ers	nfl	John, are you drunk again?Constantly.
fo4e5lg	1587502795	Raiders	nfl	Lynch played pretty well when he came back to the Raiders, the rest of the team just sucked
fo4e5o9	1587502796	Falcons	team	True but he was first team all pro the year after those injuries.. hes still a good TE
fo4e5ut	1587502799	Buccaneers	nfl	Please be aware that we dont want to be a sub where Buc Hate is spread
fo4e5xw	1587502800	Giants	nfl	Most wireless mouses that are 1ms are going to cost you 100 dollars. Thats not worth it to not have a wire in my opinion and not really cost effective. If look at corsair, razer, logitech etc.. almost all their 1ms mice are 100
fo4e5y9	1587502800	Ravens	nfl	So a player can retire but they are still under contract. The reason for this is that it prevent players from retiring from one team and then just joining another. Its a preventative measure to make sure players dont abuse the system. And just incase the player decides they want to come back, it gives them an instant in back into the league. At any point the team can trade that contract, as long as the player involved agrees to it. Even if he doesnt play. Its an interesting situation but I understand why it exist.
