They literally can not, the salary cap is real. They have to pay Watson and Tunsil, also Cunningham, Reid, etc. Arizona can afford this because they have a QB on a rookie contract.Nuk was the face of this teamYou spelt Deshaun Watson wrong.When they trade WAtSoN over some dumb excuse how will you blame Deshaun?Wait, what?

The nfl rule is only one yard vs 3 in college and its never properly called. So a bit of a whine, but a legitimate complaint when trying to play defense.

fo43bbk	1587497478	Texans	team	I mean that would be cool. Dunn is a solid run stuffer but not a pass rusher.  Jernigans deal is essentially a little over 1M though unless he hits goals and maxes out just over 3M I think.  If hes a starter then thats an unbelievably great GM move.  My feeling is Omenihu and a Rookie pick at 40 end up starting with Jernigan for vet depth on 43 looks and Dunn will be used as a NT on 34 Looks.	0.8686
fo43bq5	1587497483	Colts	team	Seriously, it blows me away when people act like he should be untouchable. Hes been okay, but nothing spectacular.

fo43bzs	1587497487	Packers	team	The Patriots unprecedented, and likely unrepeatable, success over the last 20 years has made this such a common narrative, but the reality is winning even one super bowl is hard af.  Thats the reason Favre, Rodgers, Brees and other amazing QBs have only won one.  Other greats also havent even won one.  Entire FRANCHISES havent even won one despite existing for over 50 years (I wont name names ahem Lions, Vikings) despite have incredible teams over the years that arguably should have won. So this whole narrative that his career was wasted is old and dumb.  The stars must align in order to come out on top, and there are some factors that just cant be planned for or helped.  That being said, the Packers will win the next 4 SB titles and Rodgers will ride off into the sunset as the best QB of all time.	0.9749

fo43coc	1587497496	Patriots	team	LSUs KLavon Chaisson is the perfect scheme fit for us, as a hybrid combo of Chandler Jones and Jamie Collins as the SLB in our 34.He sets a phenomenal edge, which is the most important thing for a Belichick edge defender, excels on inside stunt rushes, has good speed and foot quickness, and has shown ability to play man coverage on RBs and TEs.He might drop as his ability as a pure power rusher is raw, but we seldom use those types of roles. Hes a nearperfect player for us, and I wouldnt even mind moving up to grab him. And for those who say BB doesnt trade up in the first... we did in 2012, moving up from 27 to 21 for Chandler Jones (and 31 to 25 for Hightower)	0.8589

fo43djk	1587497508	Packers	team	This TE class is very weak. Decent depth but the top guys are bad. Sternberger wouldve been the 1 TE in this class. We got our guy. He basically redshirted last season and wouldve cost us a second or even a first this year. Packers got a great value. Last year was one of the most stacked TE classes in years, and we got the 4th best one in the class. Grossi has an interview with Sternberger who says he would be TE1 this year easily, according to his coach. I agree with him. This WR class is so, so much better that we need to get one. I agree Rodgers needs more pass catchers in general, not just WR. But the way this draft is, WR is definitely the answer. Pittman Jr., who will definitely be available for us if we want him, would immediately be the second best WR on the roster.	0.9906

fo43nbh	1587497641	Jets	team	You say he was a bad pick at 3 and then you blame the coaches for not developing him to be worthy of the draft position?  You cant have it both ways dude.

Career stats of 54.5 completion, 4900 yards, 27 TDs and 21 INTs in 22 games. Elway didnt drag anyone anywhere.So, the point you were trying to make is wrong on both accounts.1.

Also theyre just not going to get a good enough offer (e.g. 3 first rounders, plus more picks) in exchange for the 2 spot, since Tua is far from a sure bet at this point.       Id love to see them trade down from 66, depending on who is there.      I would also not be surprised to see them draft a LB in the 3rd round, despite the needs at TE and WR.  Rivera and Del Rio love LBs, and if theres a good one there I think theyll take one.

fo447sf	1587497914	Colts	team	Eason is your prototypical NFL prostyle offense college QB. Can throw the ball a mile, but has issue with accuracy and decision making at times. Its a big part of why Fromm, who is NOT a prototypical NFL QB(his arm strength is more on par with Russell Wilson, but with less mobility) kept the starting job at UGA after Eason recovered from his injury. Hurts is a high riskhigh reward guy. Best NFL comparison is Jameis Winston with better leadership traits. He has a good arm and can run, but I feel like he tends to tuck and run a little too much. Definitely benefited from playing subpar defenses in the Big 12 last season. Struggled a little v SEC defenses(LSU, first half vs UGA). Upgrade over Jacoby in he has more confidence.Id rather have Eason than Hurts. He fits the role in Reichs offense better, and I feel like Hurts will give up a bit too much behind our line.

fo44ee9	1587498005	Patriots	team	At 23, I think we should focus on the front 7. Queen, Murray, GrossMatos, Epenesa or Chassion (he may be off the board by then).We could also trade back into the second and we could be in range for Baun. I think we definitely need to draft at least two receiving threats whether it be WR or TE. As I said to a few friends of mine, I might flip a table if day 2 passes and we havent drafted at least one pass catcher. A day 3 guy that I think may be available is Quez Watkins from Southern Miss. 6 foot burner who runs a 4.35 and can also compete for jump balls. Well probably take a flier on a QB in the later rounds too if not earlier.Then again, I never have a clue what to surefire expect from Belichick aside from a DB in the second (even though we dont have one this year... yet)	0.6705

fo44j1p	1587498069	Jets	team	Its close, but Lamb is considered to have a lot better agility and YAC ability, and more tape coming out of the X WR spot as opposed to the slot (Jeudy lined up in the slot a lot). Additionally, Lamb is very good at being physical and surprisingly great at run blocking from what Ive seen. Jeudy does have better top end speed and outstanding route running in his favor, so its obviously close, but Lambs tool set looks closer to WR1 than Jeudy does at the moment.	0.9864

fo44kot	1587498091	Packers	nfl	Maybe, maybe not. I know NFL teams have private companies that do a shit ton more research on players. Last year on KFAN (Minneapolis sports radio) they were talking to one of the company heads who works with 1 team from each division (so 8 teams) and the testing they did was insane. Some stuff I remember is they had like a wolf (trained) or something chase them to find out some sort of instinct. Had tests for like toe strengthgrip for olinemen. Had a taser test. They would try and test them in as many time zones and altitudes as possible to find the affects those had on players. Might be harder with the whole quarantine this year but at they combine youd learn a little. Their private companies would learn what the prospect had at dinner July 18th 2009.I forget his name but he use to have a book hed publish after the draft of the info but I dont think he does anymore.	-0.0516

He loves 4 WR sets with a decent mix between short curl routes and fadesverticals.  He often mixes those spread plays with play action and horizontal WR progressions.  He definitely wants to run first, expect us to run on first and 10 about 60 of the time.  Well see a lot of max protect variants which will require our WRs to block or sell blocks. He loves having max protect into a 3 WR play action.  We probably wont see a ton of motion plays, he likes being static and relying on play action to shift the formation.	0.9788

Instead he dismisses that and throws the wrong type of ball to the wheel route and didnt give his guy a chance to make a play.

fo44v1t	1587498228	Packers	team	Because scouts pour over hundreds of hours of tape for a single prospect.  I would trust their evaluations over Rodgers who probably has seen some highlights of guys.  He probably offers some input with LaFluer like, Hey, wouldnt it be awesome if we had a guy who could do this... and LaFluer likely takes in Rodgers perspective and then relays the types of players he would like for his scheme up the Gute and the front office.Involving players can be a really touchy issue.  If you engage one player, others will start to clamor for a voice in the process and suddenly its spiraling out of control.  A lot of these guys dont have a great sense of self (none of us really do), so while its easy to say, of course, a backup would never think they have as much say as Rodgers, these guys are competitors and believe they are the best at all times.	0.9131

If there was an agreed upon metric that OBJECTIVELY measured talent, then there wouldnt be any debate and the draft would be in an agreed upon, set order, every year.  I do not agree that Cousins is a top 10 QB. I do believe he is replaceable. I also honestly believe that youre an unpleasant person and I didnt come here to talk to unpleasant people that belittle me for seeing things differently than they do. Youre just some dude on reddit, man  youre not gods gift to football analysis. And, honestly, you would probably learn a lot more about football by listening to other people, even if you dont agree, instead of being an arrogant dickhead and telling them theyre thoughts and opinions are so ridiculous that they no longer qualify, in your eyes, as opinions at all.  Lets be clear about this. We obviously disagree, but neither of us have proven anything, because you cant prove opinions and you cant measure talent. Given that we have stated our opinions and they cannot be proven right or wrong, there is literally no reason for us to communicate any further.

Not having anything to do with Chase Young specifically, but more with the fact that EVERY player has a chance (small or large) they wont work out, even Young.Given that premise, I would rather have MORE shots than fewer.

Even if Belichick didnt want to do a rebuild, its already started because over the last few years we lost too much talent and failed to replace almost all of it.I think ideally we either extend Gilmore to make sure hes still here in a few years when we actually are able to compete again, or yeah we trade him.

fo455x6	1587498374	Eagles	team	It was indeed out of necessity, but the offense slogged because we were bogged down with Robert Davis, Deontay Burnett, and JJAW serving as our outside WRs and the focus was on the middle of the field. Why shouldnt we address the WR position on the outside when Alshons recover will almost certainly extend into the season (if hes even here by the start of next season), DJax will probably miss games as thats what seems to be the norm for him since hes been in the league, and JJAW hasnt shown to be remotely close to being consistent? Drafting a slot that early means overloading the middle with players with all of the same strengths and likely have similar weaknesses. That means that in 12 personnel, at least one (if not two) of Jefferson and the TEs is going to be forced into a position where theyre all in the middle of the field or one of them is working an area of the field that puts them at a disadvantage. If we had a go to guy on the outside, thats a completely different conversation, but the outside is a major point of concern both in the short term and long term and slot WRs are easier to find than outside WRs. We can take someone like Tyler Johnson in the 4th.	-0.1424

fo45e7x	1587498485	Lions	team	Dude this exactly my point thats where the media has these guys going, not scouts and front offices. Thats for entertainment purposes they dont know what its like to evaluate a player. They are only compiling various information across the country and trying to fit it in what people are going to do on draft day thats what mock drafting is all about it has nothing to do with talent evaluation from the medias perspective. They are paid to write a story and thats it. How many elite talents do you think are in each draft class? Spoilers its not 32. Its not 5 either, or 3. Its usually a lot closer to 12 on an averagegood year. Youre assuming that every front office has a universal evaluation of all elite prospects because thats what the media suggests they should be ranked as. Thats entirely false. No FOs think exactly the same because theres more than one way to win, more than one philosophy and more than one way to evaluate a player. Andrew Thomas isnt flashy, so he gets mocked lower, but his game shows him dominating the highest level of competition in the NCAA, same as Wills. Thats what makes them elite talents, a mock draft done by CBS suggestion they go 15th overall does not. You also have to go by a teams roster construction and scheme fit. If you have two guys ranked as elite talents, but one fits an immediate or future need, then you draft that player regardless of the mythological positional value that gets thrown around. Sometimes guys fall because of schemeneed pulling ahead when it comes to grading. I guaranty you, there is not one front office person who gives a shit about what the media says they should do with their picks. If that were the case, Dwayne Haskins would have been a Top 5 pick last year and Josh Allen would be on the Giants while Daniel Jones would have been drafted in Round 2.	0.7923

I know production in college means pretty little, but I just dont see how he could be that talented in a major conference and go undrafted. Unless there is some crazy shit under the surface. But his character concerns seem sort of bogus. His coaches go to bat for him on twitter and shit. Local reporters said he never said no to an interview. And I dont see how it could be a work ethic character concern. With just aight athleticism he converted from a QB to a really good receiver in pretty short order.	0.3229

Motion, misdirection, quick slants and hitches (lots of west coast concepts), multiple TE sets, etc. Tons you can do to hide any weaknesses.If your WR gets beat, you cant hide that. If you run man and your CB gets beat, you cant hide that. And so on. Thats why for the better part of a decade weve seen teams like NYG or OAK invest heavily in OL and it hasnt turned out too well. Thats why we saw one of the best OLs in history on the Cowboys go 412. A great OL can make a great team excellent. But you shouldnt be investing heavily in it until youre already a great team.	0.9533

fo45pyb	1587498643	Cardinals	team	Its tough for a team to think 23 years ahead. GMs and coaches are on a short leash so almost always in win now mode. Rarely do you see a raidersgruden situation where they give 10 yrs to control the team. Gruden has the flexibility of trading away top talent for draft picks to rebuild the position players and hold off on getting rid of carr. I think carr will be gone next year when raiders have enough pieces in place. Your theory assumes two first round number 1 picks though? How you going to get burrow otherwise? Too risky.	0.8358

Usually the curse descends upon a franchise for a few years and then they figure it out.My favorites with the Raiders were Jim Breech who missed a 19 yard FG against the Chiefs in 1979 to tie the game and send it into OT. I think Al cut him the next week and then Breech spent the rest of his career kicking for the Bengals.Then there was a Errol Mann, a retread from the Lions. A straight over the top kicker like Mark Moseley he was horrible when he played for the Raiders. The year Oakland won their first SB Mann missed something like 6 PATs and half of his FG attempts. I know he missed a couple of kicks in the SB. Woof.	0.34

fo45tji	1587498693	Jets	nfl	This is something that only Cowboys fans have been clamoring for, and theyve done so without any facts and just trying to read between the lines. So lets get some things straight. 1. Were not shopping Adams. If you call, we listen. Just like last fall. Were not the ones calling, and were gonna have to be blown away by the offer. Again, just like last fall. 2. His price is not just a 1st rounder. Its 2. His price at the trade deadline was a shade under what the Jaguars got for Jalen Ramsey(httpstwitter.comAlbertBreerstatus1189270535714344960). So lets put to rest the idea that Jamal is worth only 17. 3. Joe Douglas has said he wants Jamal to be a Jet for life. Even today he said that Jamal was a big reason for him picking the Jets job(httpstwitter.comRichCiministatus1252678627151556610?s19). JD said a lot of good things about Jamal today, but Im sure this wont stop idiots from thinking that the Cowboys should be calling the Jets and offering half of what Jamal is really worth to us. 4. Extension talks are going to happen. In fact, both sides initially talked at the combine, but the front office is currently focused on the draft. I expect the extension talks to heat up by next week. No, our relationship with Jamal isnt at a breaking point. The man will get his money and end up the highest paid safety in the NFL, and itll probably come with a pretty hefty signing bonus as a little cherry on top.	0.984

However, teams that played his team would adjust to try to keep him off the field.  They would play for the turnover every time, and they know his team is never going to go for it on fourth down, so they are never jumping offsides on a hard count either.  It also would cause a rules change as 31 of 32 teams would vote for rule to obviate this superpower.  Id say 4th round for the impact he would have in his 12 seasons of play.	0.7964

Another thing is everyone keeps attributing all this contract negativity towards Dak but does no one think its the FO that had Dez and Zeke hold out?

If Simmons is the pick, I would not be upset because I think a pass rusher is the biggest need at the moment, but I worry about his size. Body wise, hes very similar to Vic Beasley. Now, is Simmons a better athlete than Vic coming out? I believe so, but body size does account for a lot when youre having to fight through blocks.

And since the Giants would certainly take a LT at 4, they basically have the same options at 5 that they would have had a 3 without any trades. Either with the trade or without, theyre basically guaranteed their choice of either Okudah or Simmons.I think the trade could realistically look like thisWAS trades 1.2 to MIADET trades 1.3 to WASMIA trades 1.5 and 1.18 to DET, and trades a 3rd to WAS	0.1531

Someone like Mahommes or Jackson, they cannot he argued. What are you talking about?Draftees have never played a down in the NFL. There is no sample size lol. That is an awful analogy.

Youre absolutely right that you dont draft for need. If its a close call between multiple players, then sure, perceived need can be used a sort of tiebreaker, but if theres a clear top guy on the board, thats the pick.

The only thing I dont fully agree with is whether its a GM or coach issue. Based on all the press conferences and the information Ive seen, I personally believe that RR is calling the shots. Im sure he highly values Kyle Smiths opinion, I mean he would have got rid of him with the rest of Bruces staff. So Smith has say, but if the coach said I dont want this guy on my team. He doesnt fit with the culture, I cant imagine a front office executive in the NFL saying tough shit, were keeping him....

fo46lfm	1587499072	Bears	team	I mean I understand what youre saying, but Nagy was clearly 1) forcing Mitch to throw because he did not want him running and reinjuring himself and 2) for forcing him to develop as an RPO pocket passer the only way you can giving him more reps.Generally, I agree with you. Nagy fucked up the play calls. He squandered the run game. His O Line schemes were a joke (and if he wasnt designing the O Line plays he is still responsible for the guy who was).That said, I dont think your characterization of how he handled Mitch is fair. Did Nagy put Mitch in the best position to win? No. Did he put Mitch in the best position to develop and grow as a QB in an RPO system? I would argue, yes. Yes he did. Mitch simply couldnt take that next step... for a variety of reasons. But not because Nagy didnt give him the opportunity.The bottom line is that Nagy needs a QB who can run his offense. Nick Foles can and has run a Matt Nagy style offense. So if Foles sucks this year and we see the same struggles as Trubisky, we will know Nagy is the problem.	0.9773

fo46ofq	1587499113	Cowboys	nfl	Its because Romo was the better QB at the time, thats why it is easy to call it in hindsight.

The only mystery is how long would Romo be able to play, and that was the risk the coaches didnt want to take in messing up the team momentum. Romo conceded and put the team before himself.

fo46o6q	1587499109	Lions	team	I dont get your logic for differentiating Okudah and Brown because you use projected to be when referencing Brown but ignore them for Okudah. If we are talking about projections, okudah far exceeds brown in terms of majority thought on his standing and ceiling. Most analysts agree that the kinlawbrown potentialceiling debate leans toward kinlaw, whereas okudah is consistently thought to be a top five, shutdown m2m corner in the future. Okudah also has consistent tape to back that up, locking down everyone on any team without giving up a play over 40 yards nor having a DPI called against him, whereas Brown was neutralized in a few spots, especially the Alabama game. I think brown is a great prospect as well but to say that okudah would be a worse pick from a collegiate performance analysis or projection level would be wrong. Another counterpoint is that this regime hasnt had major success finding good corners in the draft, I would say oruwariye is the best and he has very minimal playtime to make a decisive conclusion. Tabor comes to mind especially. I think Simmons is a different conversation as I have him rated extremely close to okudah but his positional versatility can also be his weakness if the coaching staff doesnt understand how to utilize him correctly, so i think its perfectly rationale for a coachGM tandem on the potential brink of their tenure to go with okudah as a safer, projectable pick....	0.9676

I feel like if its a draft pick, people (mostly our fans) are going to think it warrants a higher pick on name value alone but it is hard to imagine that in a real world scenario. Hes a great, albeit oft injured player who took a year off and didnt look dominant the last time we saw him.

fo46sy2	1587499174	Bears	team	Id rather wait a year before we invested a third or more into a QB.While our QB situation is unknown we also have needs at WR, OL, and CB, and weve at least have a potential high upside option at QB(due to the coaching staff), so I wouldnt say its more of a need than the other positions.Plus, I dont think there will be a QB thats the BPA in the second as well. if we trade back and take HurtsEason if they fall I wouldnt mind, but I think we would get more impact from this draft by going close to offensive BPA(while adding defensive pieces where the value is right), and imo that might have us drafting a QB in the 67th.At the very least it would help form a more solid base if we end up taking a QB in 2021.	0.6897

fo46ta5	1587499179	Falcons	team	You have to ask if you are comfortable with 3 of your family members, friends, neighbors, customers, dying unnecessarily.Thats the best question. Its one thing to say let 3 die so I can have money when its just a number and its just strangers on the news. Its a whole other ballgame when its your father, mother, brother, sister, wife, best friend, and so on.But there are two things wrong with this discussion. First, the 3 death rate is not some etchedinstone constant. That number is 3 because we have been taking these measures. We have kept the number of severely ill people low enough so our healthcare system is not overwhelmed. Go back to work and the number of people who need to be hospitalized at any given time rises sharply. We run out of room in the hospitals, run out of supplies, we dont have enough doctors and nurses. That happened in Italy and they had to make difficult decisions on who to treat and who to let go. It wont be a 3 death rate any more.Heres the other problem. Again we have the 3 death rate. Also we have 80 of people making a full recovery. What about that missing 17? People hardly talk about those people. Theres a big difference between survival and recovery. It remains to be seen what life will be like for them in the long term but their lives could be forever changed. Theres a big difference between survival and recovery.	-0.5959

fo46ton	1587499184	Dolphins	team	This would be such a bizarre move. All weve heard this year is how deep the tackle class is. Theres four you cant really choose between and a definite second tier that most years would push to be amongst the top linemen available. Why would you waste draft capital to trade up for one of those, when if you really want a certain one he will be there. This only makes sense if you retain 5, which strikes me as very unlikely given that the Lions will want to land a top player regardless, or its misinformation to try and lower the price of coming up for a QB. Those are the only scenarios I can think in which this makes sense. What I think it much more likely is we come up from 18 for a tackle, if one begins to slide. If we do come up to 3 for a tackle and pass up TuaHerbert, I might have to drink like its midseason.	-0.1639

fo46x0g	1587499230	Broncos	team	I dont think focusing on high character players necessarily means they are less physical potential.  I do think it shortens the list tremendously.  20 players can have tons of talent but if you trimmed it to players with good heads on their shoulders, that list can be cut to 35 players.  But, this approach also includes avoiding the lowcharacter players so it looks like there is a good chance theyll miss out on talent from the outside looking in.  I dont believe the team is valuing good character that much over talent.  I think they are putting more value on good character along with talent.  Maybe a formula or equation to it?

fo46wss	1587499227	Eagles	nfl	Okay let me tell you all the reasons on why a kicker should never be taken in a high round. After this I would like to see your reasoning because all you do is dick off and prove no knowledge of football at all whatsoever. Kickers have long careers, so of course they score a lot of points. Every touch down scored, they get a point. That adds up. Plus field goals. A player scoring a touch down is much less common then a kicker scoring. If a running back gets a touch down, thats 6 points, but they only score ever so often. A kickers career will last 2 or 3 times more than  a running back. Onto the next point, which is the draft. A kicker is only on the field for extra points kickoffs and field goal attempts. Compared to every other position (excluding special team exclusives), that is a very limited amount of time. Players in offense and defense play significantly more time. If you are using a high round draft pick, that person is most likely talented and has exhibited special skills. They will play much more on the field, meaning more value for that pick. Throughout history, kickers were never really taken high because there was no reason to. And if there was, GMs would do it, but they dont, because it would be idiotic and less beneficial for the team. Thats why taking a kicker in a high round is stupidly idiotic, and something the only stupidly idiotic GM would do, which is Bill OBrien, bringing me back to my original comment.	-0.5457

fo46y0i	1587499244	Chargers	team	So basically, he doesnt read stuff well enough because he doesnt come off of how he was taught to read the play, and throws it to his first read when the guy is open?  I just dont see how thats a knock on him, that he throws the play the way his coaches want him to.... Like I said, this seems like the perfect example of his coaches hamstringing him either with bad scheme, or bad teaching, because it SHOULD be read that way, but that doesnt mean he was taught to.Also I dont really think that he thew that ball in the wrong place.  The S already broke on that and took away the bullet.  Thats another one where it seems like a landmark throw.  He lofted both to the sideline, so Im betting thats just how they want him to throw that play.  But again, none of us know any of this and were both completely speculating to argue our points, so its pretty much a moot point. Honestly thats one detail that always annoys me about him.  Hes put like 34 hail mary balls into the crowd. Its insanely frustraing.  Is that what youre talking about.If you say that you dont see big ben flashes then go watch the Colorado game, or the Wazzu game. Hes fairly similar to Carson Wentz too.  But he just dominates those games. People are ridiculously out of control with this blind hating on Herbert.

fo472vl	1587499311	49ers	team	2017 and 2018 were rebuilding years with Lynch and Shanahan publicly mentioning they were playing with house money. With the success in 2019, they have now buckled down in their approach with cap management  restructuring McKinnon, trading Buckner for a top 15 draft pick, and extending key players (e.g. Ward, Armstead) with cap flexibility terms. I dont think the RB situation is unique. Teams that overpay for free agents generally dont see the output to justify the cost  regardless of position.

They play 16 games a year which is countless different combinations of these unique individuals going against each other. You cant break all that down into a couple of charts and say see running the ball doesnt impact the outcome of your offense. What I can trust is the countless people who actually play the game saying yes running the ball is helpful toward opening up our gameplanNow Pete Carroll if definitely stubborn but not because he thinks running is good, but because hes not willing to deviate. The patriots do it best when its suits them to run more they run a lot but they can also come out and throw it 50 times if the defense is over playing the run.	0.9657

fo47c2q	1587499437	Giants	nfl	Its not popular to disagree with the point youre trying to make, but Ill do it anyway. This is completely apples and oranges as far as comparisons go. Peyton Manning was drafted to a terrible Colts team who had been in constant rebuild mode for much of the 90s. People viewed them like they were a worse version of the current Texans (ignoring the recent idiocy of BoB even). They could go 88 or 97 in the division, maybe win a wild card game, but no one took them seriously as a contender. Peyton Manning changed that perception comprehensively and was being labeled a top QB in the league before he took the field. The team and organization he played for werent great without him, and some seasons were just outright bad. Compare that with Baltimore who hasnt been able to field a bad defense in 2 decades, is never out of the playoff hunt in any season, and is frequently viewed as the kryptonite to the best dynasty in sports history. Flacco was struggling and the offense couldnt get out of their own way before Lamar took over, but he still did so with an extremely stable organization and perennial contender team. Peyton also was viewed as great playing as a traditional QB who showed the ability to master every single prototypical QB trait. That is the oppose of how Lamar has done it. Im aware he led the league in TD throws last year, but even knowing that Im not aware of anyone who thinks he is a great traditional passer in the way Russ, Mahomes, the various other young guys out there are. He makes plays that no one since Vick has made and its not clear how long he will be able to do that. Is it fair to call him a gimmick? Probably not. But its also not realistic to say you can compare his lack of playoff success to the lack of success Manning had early on considering theres nothing else similar about their environments other than both being one and done in their first two attempts.	0.838

fo47ikt	1587499526	Titans	nfl	Not sure why youre being downvoted. Everytime you see ultra wires posted to rBattlestations or pcmasterrace or wherever else, the conversation inevitably turns to ultrawides vs dual monitors. Plenty of people who made the swap to ultrawides have said they miss having two monitors (rather than having to screen split and mess with whatever app is doing it) and plenty have ended up using dual ultrawides, or ultrawides flanked by standard monitors (either in portrait or landscape mode).I think right now the breakdown is basically to get an ultra wide if you mostly want to do super immersive gaming. But if youre going to be using multiple applications  even gaming on one monitor with discordSpotifybrowser on the other  youll probably still be happier with dualtriple monitors. Especially because its still probably cheaper to get higher refresh rates in your multiple monitors than getting a 4K monitor about 60hz. And if youre getting an ultra wide that is either a) below 144 Hz or b) not 4K  whats the point?	0.6877

I mean how can you fault that if thats really how he dealt. However, something about him has not felt right since retirement, its felt like a cash grab or trying to pump up his own brand and I get it if it benefits your own personal interests and future. His endeavors obviously havent panned out post his playing career and he wasnt having fun in New England. Loved the guy playing here but he has become a contradictive nuisance since.

This is a shittier TE class, on the other hand, so I wouldnt count on finding anything in the draft there.Also, we dont need to (and probably wont) fix everything in one draft, especially one where we dont have a second round pick. Be patient. This is not going to be an overnight rebuild. Were not competing for shit this year. Just take BPA and then see what happens next offseason when we have a shitton of cap space to play with and in all likelihood yet another top5 pick. Unless its a QB, you just dont draft for need and find success in this league. We could have Derwin James on this roster right now if wed gone BPA.	0.9265

Linemen rarely last longer than age 32 and thats especially true for someone who is injury prone.  We should draft a long term solution at LT and spend that cap money on something else like defense.  Its frankly ridiculous we are even considering it (and it may be a smokescreen).  We are paying top dollar to our guard (6 highest paid), center (6) , and right tackle (3) right now.  Add in a 15 million left tackle and we will find ourselves in cap hell in two years.

fo47rz7	1587499655	Vikings	team	I disagree with everything you just said lol. We literally did all of those things to mitigate our weakness at G, and we had a bottom 5 offensive line. You can only hide so much. You named two of the most important positions in WR and CB. G isnt the sexiest,or the most important position on the field, but if your G group is one of the worst in the league, it will ruin games for you, and it did for us. Multiple times. For every team like Oakland, there is a team like Philly, who also invested heavily in their offensive line, and it turned out well. Almost like there are other important positions on the offense that matter. As for Ruiz, saying that he would be the worst 1st round pick since Treadwell doesnt mean much, seeing as the only 1st round picks we have had since then have been Hughes and Bradbury. He will go in the 1st, and it will be a good pickup for whatever team gets him. He is a versatile, strong IOL who can move well. He will have a good shot to become a long term starter in this league imo.	0.4684
fo47sb1	1587499660	Eagles	team	Except not lots of cheers, but explosive standing ovation when he enters the game.  Like a gameinterrupting standing ovation.

fo47tkd	1587499677	Bears	nfl	In all seriousness, how does this makes any sense for the Bucs? They have a younger, very likely healthier and football ready OJ Howard (who doesnt seem to me getting very good return value in trade talks considering hes still on their team). Gronk couldnt stay healthy at all towards the end of his career and now hes not in football shape. Gronk was great, but this isnt 2015 anymore. Plus, theres no way Bill is just gonna hand his rights to Tampa for nothing and help Tom out, so the Bucs are probably going to have to take on his remaining cap hit and give up additional value. From a football perspective I dont understand it	0.8027

If the economy was as strong as yall dummies claimed, and if yall dummies knew how to manage an economy and nation, we should have had more than enough resources prepared to handle this crisis. Kemp and his party have handled this poorly every single fucking chance theyve had and now you want to risk making this situation worse because the Republicans have been nonstop shitting the bed for almost an entire century and you dont want any of the blame or clean up any of the mess yourselves.

If you are unaware it iswas (IDK if its still a thing) a prerecorded reality show where fighters would face off once a week in an elimination tournament with the final two contestants meeting on a UFC event to determine the winner. Well there was a particular season which featured Kimbo Slice who was a internet celebrity streetfighter. There was a bunch of buzz about people wanting to see him in the UFC. But he had no actual mixed martial arts experience. That same season there was another fighter named Roy Nelson who had already been a champion in a smaller organization and had 3 losses (2 by decision) against UFC Champions. The guy was pretty much a ringer. Here is the kicker. The odds came out right as the show came on television. Its prerecorded. They already know the 2 guys fighting for the championship. The public just doesnt know. I knew. I knew one of the coaches. Kimbo Slice was 200 Roy Nelson was 400 Brendan Schaub was 800 (who Nelson fought in the finale)Kimbo Slice got eliminated the first week on the show. The max bet allowed was 250. I bet 250 on Roy Nelson and it was easy money. I imagine plenty of people knew but the books knew there would be plenty of suckers getting money on Kimbo for name value.	0.926

fo487b9	1587499865	Patriots	team	Fine just take the whole team while youre at it! FUCK! At first I was happy for Tom but now Im starting to get annoyed. This is like seeing your ex prospering and enjoying life without and with all her new friends and newly found singleness except its plastered all over social media and news and sports segments none of which you could avoid. I wish Tom would have retired as a Patriot. Gone off into the sunset. That would have been the most ideal situation. I was fine with Gronk being retired and being the goofball that he is and enjoying life but now seeing he wants to come back AND play for another team?? Fucking a.Theres no way they give up OJ Howard for Gronk, theyd be fools not to play with a solid 12 TE combination. Theyll give up something else.DAMMIT!	0.9631

fo487oc	1587499870	Patriots	team	Alright honestly fuck this. Brady and Gronk are my two favorite Patriots.

Once theyre both retired for good Ill be much happier. Until then I cannot look at either of them the same way at the moment.	0.7447

fo48803	1587499875	Buccaneers	nfl	Thatd be a really bad trade for us. We all have every reason to think Gronk would only come back for one year before retiring again, whereas OJ will be turning just 26 during the season and has a lot of football ahead of him. Theres also the investment put into each player by their respective organizations. Gronk was a second rounder and OJ cost us 17th overall.Beyond that, BB tried to trade for OJ last season, so we have leverage. He wants OJ for the future and we want to win now. They would have to give up at least one of their shitload of picks in addition to Gronk.	0.4779
fo4884s	1587499876	Patriots	team	So, this isnt gonna be popular, but Gronk has all the leverage if he wants to come back. How much cap space do we have? How much is his hit immediately if he unretires? No one will trade for him if hes just gonna retire again, which means the only ones who will do it are the Bucs. If only one team will trade for him, youre not getting a ton of return. So you either cut other players to keep Gronk if he returns, or you take what the Bucs offer to get him off the books. Whether the Bucs want to be nice about it is a different story.	-0.4062

Hes much more athletic and has much more upside entering the draft than Beasley did in my opinion because of his hybrid abilities. I agree with your point that he needs to add more weight, somewhere around ten pounds, but comparing his weight to defensive ends that are only supposed to sack the quarterback is unfair.	-0.1638

fo489il	1587499896	Chiefs	team	A great offensive line accounts for almost half of your offensive starters, so of course 12 of your offense being considered great is likely to lead to success, but were just talking about upgrading a single position, and no single position outside of QB is strongly correlated with winning.Taking pass rushers as an example, just 2 of the 8 passrushers selected to APs 2019 AllPro team made the playoffs (Cameron Jordan and DeForest Buckner). For comparison, 33 of the offball LBs selected to the AllPro FirstTeam made the playoffs, for what thats worth (Wagner, Davis, and Kendricks). So again, teams with a strong pass rush are probably going to do well just because thats 411 of your starting defense, but as a single position, pass rushers just arent that much more impactful than any other position.	0.9186

You realize teams put outs into NFL contracts so they can dump players before the contract expires if theyre not playing up to certain standards, right? I understand where Hop is coming from but its just weird to me.  It seems like the NFL is the only big 4 league where players do this. This is exactly the case, because the other 3 leagues operate with guaranteed contracts. In a sport where you are most sacrificing your longterm health, have the shortest window to earn, and can be cut by the team with years remaining, players will always be looking to adjust their pay closer to market value.	0.5159

Play action honestly sets up the run game as much as vice versus because it forces the d to respect your receivers a little more. But I think especially in the pros you need both for the gameplan to work. The key is to avoid being one dimensional even if it seems like your passing or running game isnt working too well.	0.7121

And that team would also know that Trent could easily pull the shit he pulled last year on us, and report at the 11th hour and then make up some shit about his helmet, so what the fuck leverage do we have?

fo48j0b	1587500026	Bills	team	 He threw a football 72 MPH which is the equivalent to 110 MPH with a baseball. You keep saying that shit, but its not true. Its as much higher than a typical Combine throw as a 110 mph fastball would be in MLB, but theyre not the same thing. I dont need to prove that he cant throw 110 MPH. Youre the one thats making that ludicrous claim. Youre the one that needs to prove it. Like 4and1punt, Ive never seen him claim to be able to throw faster than 92 mph. You said he has multiple times. So prove it. You see, there are some fundamental physics issues at play here. With a football, strength is really important because of its size and weight compared to a baseball. With a baseball, which weighs much less, strength is still important, but technique is where you maximize speed. You need to create several synergizing whip actions at the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and fingertip to get to that kind of speed, But mechanically, there are some limitations to how much speed the human body can create. To throw a baseball 110 mph, you need to accelerate your fingertips to 110 mph with perfect mechanics, and thats probably not possible. It certainly has NEVER happened. Not even close. Aroldis Chapman is about as close as anyones ever gotten, at 105 mph, and even that is truly freakish compared to other highspeed fastballs throughout history. Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson... for most elite, worldclass fastballers, 101102 mph is a truly exceptional throw. Youre suggesting that a guy who hasnt played baseball since high school can just come out and outperform some of the greatest in history by almost 10. Its preposterous. I would be shocked if Josh could break 100 mph.	0.9793

That would coincide roughly with the timeline when Ballard would have been discussing player performance for the previous season. You think that Ballard didnt bring up those shots that he and Desir gave up to Hopkins? Ballard was visibly pissed just a week before.I dont know whether Hooker will be traded, but I guarantee that hell be traded if Ballard feels like the offer is good enough.You cant really look at Hookers tweets and arrive at the conclusion that Ballard hasnt at least discussed the possibility of trade with Hooker, going back to midFebruary.I think theres probably an even chance that Ballard has deals on the table that are contingent on particular players being unavailable.  Sort of a we might give you pick 27 for Hooker depending on the availability of two players that were not going to specify.Look at the expression on Ballards face when hes asked about the Hooker extension.

However going off of the Taco Bell thing, its a bit different. Ultimately the Rams can do whatever they want, but one thing I believe that holds true for all sports, especially football, you want to represent your team, wear their colors, show off their merch, etc.My issue is 1. The logo is gross and majority of the fan base would agree.2. As a fan base we feel lied to and going unheard.Its hard for me to support and represent my team when they truly are disrespecting the fans by not even acknowledging us. People keep talking about this 5 year change with the logo, the team hasnt even addressed the issue. They just dont say anything and act like there isnt a riot in the comments of every single post. As a fan of the team, how can I represent and support my team when they wont listen to the fans who are upset about the representation(the logo) of our team!	0.9727

fo48uha	1587500185	Raiders	team	I disagree with most of what was written. Im not sold on brown, hes a DT that cant rush the passer. Hes not Aaron Donald, and didnt always dominate in SEC play. I cant see any way Simmons or okudah is there at 12 but yeah sure if that crazy scenario works out take one of themNo team in the top 7 Is goin to take 1219 for top pick AND a 2nd. I think we are more likely to trade 12 back to a late 1st and 2nd. I do get drafting a CB at 12 IF the guy they love is there and using 19 on a WR, yes top 3 are gone but at 12 Henderson might still be available (most peoples CB2)So then it becomes so they want Henderson at 12 and maybe Jefferson at 19 (or some other WR) Or choice of Jeudylambruggs and maybe Fulton at 19	0.9615

I want to see him in Tampa Bay, Im rooting for the Bucs (and Pats) this year for Brady, but Pats are rebuilding.   As a Boston sports fan, the biggest loss this year was Mookie Betts.  Brady is way more legendary of course, but hes going on 43 and we were not going to win with him in our current state and I expected to lose him.  Betts is a generational talent in his his prime.  I dont think too many Pats fans are salty, even the ones like me who wanted him back.  He earned the right to play for the Pats until 60 in my opinion, would have been happy to see us lose if Brady wanted to stay.  But he didnt and hes gone.  As a kid I couldnt even imagine the Patriots appearing in a Super Bowl, and this man won us 6 and took us to 9.   I will ALWAYS root for him.	0.9382

And if Romo is hurt again? The question is answered and were on to Dak without lingering questions. And they lost in the 1st round against the Packers. They had the 30th ranked secondary. They made a great come back and fell short...after Dak dug a hole in the first half and couldnt move the ball. Looking good against prevent defense doesnt make you great.

fo48ynh	1587500243	Lions	team	The Redskins have two big problems right now1.They have an incredibly weak roster. They have a great DL but after that they have 1 good WR in Terry McLaurin, a couple decent RBs, 1 decent CB in Kendall Fuller, an iffy QB in Dwayne Haskins, and ... thats really it. Aside from Fuller, they basically took in some of our castoffs and not much else this year in Free Agency. Their DL was not a problem last year and adding another DL wont fix the other problems in the defense and the roster as a whole. The thing I see most brought up when Redskins fans say theyll draft Young is having a better DL will give the Secondary help, which is true... if your DL was mediocre to bad before. Adding somebody to your one stacked position will have little benefit.2.They have a dearth of early picks and 7 picks as a whole. They have 2 overall and then their next pick is in the third round at 3.02. After that they pick at 4.03 and 4.36. Then 5.16. No Sixth. Then 7.02 and 7.15. With mediocre at best free agent signings, theyd be going into next season with basically only two new starters (Chase Young and Fuller) after losing a couple starters to free agency. They would likely be in the exact some spot this time next year as they are this year. Maybe thats what theyre going for if Ron Rivera wants either Trevor Lawrence or Justin Fields over Haskins or Tua. The amount of picks they have also may change if they trade Trent Williams, but as of right now only the Browns have been rumored to make a move and they seem to be worried about contractinjuriesagedraft compensationetc.They will almost definitely take Young but I just dont think they would be making the right choice.	0.967

fo498qn	1587500380	Redskins	team	Yeah I dont see this as anything more than them doing due intelligence. Im sure the Bengals have listened to calls, eventhough theres like a 99.99999 chance that theyve had their minds made up for months and arent moving out of 1. And the Skins options are limited. Really the only team worth trading back with is the Dolphins. Because of their draft capital, and their current draft location. I dont see the Skins going past 5.   The Chargers at 6 maybe could happen if they pull some RG3 type offer, but I dont see that happening. Theyd get their QB, but then theyd be crippled when it comes to 1st round picks for the next 23 years.	0.6757

The Browns new uniforms also look very good, especially for their hardtoswallow color scheme. A big plus for them is that the new uniforms are a huge improvement over their old ones. Ours are different, but dont look objectively better than the previous. Do you know what one of the worst parts of the Browns old uniforms was? Giant text on the front. Guess what we chose to do? Giant text on the front. Plus, monochromatic uniforms. The white pants with black jerseys looks pretty good and I hope that ends up becoming what is usually worn at home. The white jerseys go well with either white or black pants. All our jerseys would also look much better with a smaller Atlanta on the front instead of the massive ATL. Combining what others have said, the Chargers listened to the fans and paid homage to the past with an updated look on classic uniforms. The Falcons tried to be bold and deviate from the norm which produced a createateam look that youd expect to see on a TV show.	0.9481

fo49cg1	1587500429	Bears	nfl	This would be a great trade for both sides, until now it seemed like Gronk was set on staying retired and even with him wanting to come back now its just to play with Brady, not the Pats. Some people are concerned if he can stay healthy but the Buccaneers already have a really solid group of TEs that could easily be starters if something were to happen to Gronk. Hes not coming back to the Pats so this is essentjally free capital for whatever they get for him and the Buccaneers get potentially one of the best TEs in the league who already has an extremely good and established connection with their starting QB.	0.9795

Come on. This is why I only go all in on teams and dont usually idolize players. Tom Brady was different so that one hurt but all these players dont give a shit, theyll turn their backs on your team and the fans in a second. If Brady and Gronk will do it, basically the 2 I wouldve thought for sure never in a million years are going anywhere else and will retire here, well then there really isnt any loyalty. At least its extremely rare. Not saying I dont still think Tom is the greatest ever, but as a Patriots fan this entire thing has soured my overall perception of him.

But sure, him and Pace draft the same way To be fair to OP, Trubisky was the 2 overall pick and the highest draft pick Emery had was 14.   In fact, Pace has had a top 10 draft pick in each round save for 2019 so the talent hes drafted should be better than Angelo and Emery who had a top 10 draft pick only twice over the course of 15 seasons (2003 and 2005).

Clemson moves him everywhere but usually reserved the inside the box alignment for passing downs where he could match a back, blitz, or spy qb.He played a lot over the slot or dee safety on early downs where he excels both filling the run as well as in coverage	0.9394

Maybe with Brady bringing accountability and the willingness to chew your ass to pieces for not doing your job will be the boost OJ needs to finally play up to his potential.Ill roll with those two over Gronk.

fo49q2t	1587500609	Patriots	nfl	That is still a relationship, which is what Hopkins is saying didnt exist. There was an actual, personal relationship developed but the hierarchy of bossemployee was still there. And in the NFL its far more nuanced than bossemployee relationships that youd have with your boss. Nearly every major contributor to a franchise has a voice, and if they dont its usually considered dysfunctional. We expect the relationship between star players and coaches to be more involved because these are critical assets to the team. Plenty of players get the normal bossemployee treatment, but those are like deep roster guys. That happens the be most of the league. What you dont expect is the same treatment to be applied to the star players. The rules may be applied the same, but the actual relationship is often different.	0.3291

fo49qlp	1587500616	Packers	nfl	The 2017 Chiefs showed every way that the Atlanta Falcons were inept.  The Chiefs were a good team with a good quarterback.  They drafted a very talented rookie QB when they already had a good quarterback.  They saw the potential in that rookie quarterback enough to be able to coach him up and give him a future while still coaching the starter while winning games.  Alex Smith went to the pro bowl and Mahomes became the best quarterback in the game.  The Falcons on the other hand, started their Pro Bowl quarterback and made their talented rookie a side show.  Not properly giving him the coaching, reps, and attention he needed.  Letting him rot on the bench with little to no shot to play.  Chris Miller had a good season and turned back into what he was before, a bottom of the barrel starting quarterback.  If we even compare Alex Smith to Chris Miller, Alex Smith was far superior at that time and had a good track record.	0.9874

fo49v3t	1587500678	Giants	team	Im looking at the board and there are a few options for the giants to trade down and still get their choice Offensive Tackle. If they want Simmons, they can only move down with the Dolphins and Chargers really  and even the chargers is iffy. The Giants also have to bid against the Lions in any trade down scenario. Anyway, I think the following are reasonable potential trades1) 5 from Miami, the Dolphins give us a 3rd rounder maybe to prevent the Chargers from leaping them. Giants get to pick the same player they would at 4.2) 6 from LAC, the Chargers want to jump the Dolphins to get their QB and give us a 3rd rounder to get in front of Miami. Compensation is weird because this is bidding war with 2 buyers and 2 sellers. Anyway, the Giants get to pick the same player they would at 4.3) 9 from Jacksonville, the Jaguars dont want to roll with Minshew  wont wait for Lawrence next year so they jump up to grab Tua or Herbert. Giants probably get the Jaguars 2nd rounder (42) for this. Giants probably get the second tackle off the board here.Trading down further than that would require a lot of compensation, wed miss out on at least 3 and probably all of the top 4 tackles, and I dont think Gettleman wants that.Thoughts? Personally Id be happy to get one or two mid round picks from the Jags to move to 9 and grab the best tackle there.	0.2448

fo49wh4	1587500696	Eagles	team	12 personnel has been our best personnel grouping the past two seasons, even when we did have Alshon and Agholor. Perhaps it would have been different with DJax healthy freeing up the intermediate areas with his speed, but we wont have that after next season and that would be an indication that we probably need an outside, deep threat WR. The other consideration is that youre suggesting removing a proven commodity who would be at least a top 10 TE on any other team as their starter for a player who is at his best in the slot and fills a similar role. Im not saying that it would be that same result, but why would you go back to the well after both JMatt and Agholor failed to succeed on the outside after being best projected to play the slot (like Jefferson is being projected). Outside WR is our biggest hole and, again, a position where Goedert and Ertz are both serviceable playing so they all fit the same role and using a 1st on a player with a similar skillset probably isnt the best use of resources. Versatility is good, but Jefferson has underwhelmed on the outside and has issues playing press, which he will see a lot more of in the NFL. And, while I know that youre being hyperbolic, this isnt Juju or Thielen. If that were guaranteed, thats one thing, but thats not the case, otherwise Jefferson wouldnt be in play for us at 21.	0.9805

And this is coming from a Baylor student who is dying to see Denzel Moms go to New Orleans.Just because our defensive staff have DB backgrounds doesnt mean the saints dont need linebackers. Thats just a nonsequitur. LB is a major hole in our roster. The simple fact that you mention about how the last several LBs weve gotten have had injuries reinforces the fact that we need help at the position. With Anzalone and Alonso getting hurt every time they walk on a football field we absolutely have to give Demario Davis some support. Have you considered that we run schemes without many linebackers because we dont have many good ones?Additionally, THE SAINTS TRIED TO GET JAMIE COLLINS. They clearly looking for a highend LB to get our defense to the next level. It absolutely makes sense for them to get one in round 1 and get a developmental WR and maybe a QB in later rounds (thinking maybe Fine from UNT?).

Especially behind an OLine with question marks.To put it another way, in our specific case would you rather have a guy that is definitely going to get open, but you have to give him the time to get open and the ball will have to be very well thrown, or a guy that isnt going to separate as well but has a very good chance to catch the ball no matter the coverage or place on the field and will add 8 yards after the catch?	0.9303

fo4ag04	1587500962	Eagles	team	it does seem that we should consider ourselves lucky to have him still there at 21.  i dont see it, unless you want to project how he will do because most of his routes last year were with a linebacker or safety starting 7 yards off the line of scrimmage, with Jefferson running very short routes that involved one turn and look for the ball.  So, yeah project all you want how great he will be but if you want to say he is one of the best prospects in 40 years then also be honest and say you are taking a small sample of his catches and throwing out most of them that tell you little of how good a prospect he is.	0.9799

But if the Pats ended up restructing contracts to have room if they want. Hell just collect the money or retire which puts them right where they were.They could call his bluff on the fact that a Te is a young Qbs best friend.

fo4am57	1587501045	Cowboys	team	This is different for most people in the US. 46 Million people make 15 bucks an hour or less, so the boss saying that is not only a very real thing that happens on a daily basis when downsizing  but unlike Dak Prescott, 15 bucks an hour or less dont get you shit. Much less your kids. Or your grand kids. People sign up to the military with a very real risk of DYING if conflict erupts for way damn less. Average for most enlisted is around the 40k a year mark. Same with Cops. Extreme high stress, every night is a possible bad night with exposure to aids, HIV, bullets and black eyes for what? 80k a year an a uniform that everyone hates because of Racial Tensions? At 30 million a year, Id be at a loss for words and would ensure that money goes mostly into interest bearing accounts. The font cash is used to pay off any property and the remaining interest is calculated against my total living expenses to survive care free. Pure liberty. Pure freedom. No chains. And on top of that 30 million a few days worth of commercial recording and a get another 50 million just on endorsements? You fucking kidding me? How is that anything like your average Joe making 15 bucks an hour at the USPS? Come on now. Theres a point where I say yes to taking my pay cut because to me, I CHOSE my career because my career itself is just as valuable as the money. I didnt choose to go into Aerospace because it pays well and believe me, it does. I chose it because I fucking love engineering and aircraft. So if I had a choice to take a slight pay cut (10 to 15) to stay at my current job or to take the same pay BEFORE the cut, as a landfill director for the city garbage service  Id say yes. Because the career is just as important as the money is. If Dak really loves the game and loves playing, that weighs on him too. Mind you I wish the best for Dak and hes certain to get what he wants money wise AND still get to play. If we dont pay him, some one else will. Easy. He knows he can stay at his job and get a raise. By a blanket assumption that his situation is applicable to EVERYONE is asinine.	0.9971

Now my spiteful side has taken over and Im basically his biggest fan.Seriously, though, its been one year. He plays behind two of the better guys in the entire league at his position. Last year he finished with 21 tackles and 2 sacks playing only 23 of snaps. This year, assuming no major injuries at the position, hell likely see more like 4050 of snaps, and those numbers should go up accordingly. If not, then maybe its time to consider that theres a problem, but its still far too early for that.	-0.436

Even if there was an argument, budging in to spam it is never going to help anything, it just makes the argument worse and the hate directed to you, you even spam on therapy subreddits and trauma subs for fucks sake, I made this bot out of nothing but pure hatred and annoyance of you, who gave you the right to dictate what I can say?

fo4auhd	1587501158	Falcons	nfl	I would only move up if its to 1012 range for kinlawHenderson. Because we could move up for that without destroying our entire draft. But up to 59 for Simmonsokkudah just seems to be an overpay for something that wouldnt fix the team. I think it all depends what happens with tua and the tackles and how they fall or go earlier than thought.  But with the Gronk trade I see the falcons going all in for a CB.

fo4axcp	1587501196	Colts	team	 Desir and Hooker played on the same side of the field.Well, thats not true. Gamepass is free. Go back and watch the Texans game. It took me like two minutes, and that includes signing in, to prove that wrong. Desir followed Hopkins. On the deep TD to Hopkins, it was Desir and Geathers in coverage. On the deep ball to Fuller, Hooker was the safety, but he was playing Hopkins on a crossing route. The 3rd huge pass was to Fuller again in what looks like cover 3 with Moor playing deep on the outside and Hooker playing to the middle while Geathers runs up into the box right before the snap. 4th deep pass was to Hopkins with Desir on him. Hooker seems to be playing the low middle of the field in cover 3 with Geathers playing the deep middle. Not going to call this one on Hooker unless it was supposed to be cover four and he played too low. Desir has always played fine against Hopkins. In the second game last season, Desir had missed a few weeks and wasnt even practicing. Same with TY. Both were rushed back for that game and it showed. TY couldnt separate for Joseph and Desir couldnt keep up with Hopkins.	0.9669

And after a career of only Super Bowls and AFC championships he decides to come back but run when we arent the best team.

fo4b03t	1587501233	Patriots	nfl	BB didnt meet with the 3rd string QBs weekly for 11s. BB didnt meet with plenty of players for 11 time each week including starters. IDK why people are defending this idea. In the NFL coaches are known to have closer relationships with their key players. We EXPECT THAT! Thats why this is even a headline to begin with. Yes, there is a function of bossemployee in the relationship because that is the literal dynamic. But that is not the extent. Plenty of players DONT call their HC to tell them about their FA moves. There is no requirement. Especially calling the HC directly in the middle of the night. This alludes to the respect and communication between TB and BB. This is not exclusive to those two in any way either. Do you think youd care to tell your boss directly you arent coming back or would you just communicate that information through the appropriate channels and call it a day. Brady could have had his agent tell the Pats, but he didnt. Its not Bradys problem if the Pats learn about his decision via the media, he no longer plays for them. But, he called up Kraft and BB personally because he has a relationship with them. He said as much on the Howard Stern show. Brady has said many times he has a great relationship with BB. They used to go golfing in the off season. They stayed in constant communication during the offseason as well. They built a relationship around both of their desires to win. IDK why this is even a point of contention. The NFL isnt like your day job, and the coach to player interactions are not the same or comparable directly. Not establishing a meaningful relationship in the NFL is a fast way to alienate a locker room that you need dedicated to your game plan. This is a requirement. The fact that Nuk felt he and BoB didnt have a relationship at all is huge because of the norm established. Again, I have no doubt Dan Quinn has a good personal relationship with Julio. Not saying they are besties and text every day. But I have no doubt that Quinn and the OC take the time to understand Julio more personally so they can understand how he can play as effectively as possible. They need Julio to establish leadership among WRs and the offense. They need Julio to run routes he likes and feel comfortable with, and they need him to feel comfortable communicating that information. They NEED to understand who Julio is as a person to allow him to be successful, which enables them to be successful. This relationship stuff didnt matter as much in the 90s and earlier, but today, a HC is expected to know how to build and manage the people inside the building. And not doing it with a star player is not a positive spin for the HCGM. Full stop.	0.9955

fo4b2of	1587501269	Vikings	team	 I disagree with everything you just said lol.Thats OK, that doesnt change the fact that Im right.  We literally did all of those things to mitigate our weakness at G, and we had a bottom 5 offensive line. You can only hide so much.And the Vikings had a top 10 offense by DVOA despite having the 5th cheapest offense in the entire league. And we were paying sticker price for that offense  Diggs, Thielen, Rudy, Kirk, etc were all getting paid market rate. So its not like we had a star QB or WR on a rookie deal that was creating that discrepancy. Stefanski did good job at trying to hide OL deficiencies, and it worked. In the 5 years running up into their superbowl (12, 13, 14, 15, 16  won in 17), heres the OL players they drafted in the first two rounds 1. Lane Johnson at 4 overallThats it. They invested 1 high pick in OL in 6 years. Thats not investing heavily. And even when the Eagles go out and signed FAs in OL  they didnt invest heavily in the top FAs. For example, they had signed Brandon Brooks to an 8MM APY contract. The highest paid guard at the time was Kelechi Osemele, who had 12MM APY. So to say The eagles invested heavily is just not true, and its something made up to support a biased opinion.  Teams like the vikings have invested more than the Eagles. Investing in the OL doesnt work out. Saying we lost because of OL! is just a poorly informed opinion. The fact remains iOL is less important than1. QB2. WR13. WR23. CB14. CB25. CB36. LT7. RT8. LDE9. RDE10. 3T11. NT12. OLB13. ILBSo I guess that leaves it as more valuable than RB, TE, and S. 7. LB8. DT	-0.4015

Tom cant throw the ball 30 yards down the field anymore. Their WRs are studs but thats no different than last year. Jeamis threw a ton of picks but he also threw a bunch of TDs.

So, let me get it straight.. wahhh 20 years of unprecedented winning and record breaking wahhh my coach wont kiss the rings that he helped me get wahhh me bored wahhh. This wasnt about lack of weapons. With Gronk returning the would essentially be the same weapons from the 201415 seasons minus Amendola and plus James White. Just stupid BS that makes no sense to me.

Kittle is on the same tier of blocking as Gronk (possibly a tier below) but as it stands right now Kittle is much more effective in the passing game.

fo4bgag	1587501456	Eagles	team	Yes, rollover is added on to the cap. Its not a use it or lose it situation like the NBA. For this reason, looking at NFL cap space for a single year is very misleading. In reality, NFL cap space is more like a continual list. Every contract you sign counts against your cumulative cap space, forever.Scroll to the bottom page on Spotrac(httpswww.spotrac.comnflphiladelphiaeaglescap). Youll see that the 2020 NFL salary cap is 198 million, but we rolled over about 24 million from 2019, so our cap is 222 million for 2020. As of now, we are projected to have about 195 million in contracts for 2020 (not including rookies), giving us about 27 million in rollover for 2021. If we were to sign a player for 1 year, 27 million, then our rollover would be 0, which would directly impact our cap space for 2021.The closest approximation to expiring contracts is trading away future salary  a draft pick (similar to a longterm contract in the NBA, in both cases the goal is to save future cap space) in return for minimal compensation like a conditional 7th round pick (similar to a worthless player on an expiring contract in the NBA). The main difference is that in the NFL, the team trading the player away has to pay a portion of the guaranteed contract, so they cant completely shed a bad contract without a cap penalty. The team trading for the player often ends up with a decent contract with little guaranteed money, which is where the NBA comparison falls apart.	-0.1851

fo4bipd	1587501490	Seahawks	nfl	Can someone explain how he was able to pass a physical in this time? Like one of the reasons the Seahawks havent resigned Clowney was because they couldnt evaluate him with a physical. So how were the Bucs able to give Gronk a physical?	0.5574

Belichick might as well have traded me to Tampa.If Gronk looks like he did in 2017, this is a phenomenal trade for Tampa, as well.  If he looks like he did in 2018, not so much.  If he looks like last year... ouch.	0.929
fo4bjn1	1587501503	Patriots	team	Honestly surprising that a guy like Gronk lasted under Bill for as long as he did. He and Brady are going to have so much more fun in Tampa with Arians.	0.8874
fo4bjr4	1587501504	Ravens	nfl	Not a first but certainly better than a 4th. Just because gronk was retired doesnt mean he lost all value. He can easily be a top 10 tight end when he plays there is value in that.	0.9698

Drafting a guy who, according to your quotations, rightfully almost left USC after they wanted him to switch positions after being a freshman all american (and a 5 star recruit at safety) doesnt scream character concerns, and in fact the second quote only confirms that they werent a red flag as Josh Shaw specifically said he manned up and apologized.	0.7475

I cant see a scenario at 22 and 25 where it makes sense to pick a WR when we should be building in the trenches. So not only are OLDL much bigger needs in my opinion, especially since we are a run first team, but corner is clearly a bigger need than WR. Not only that, but you also take into consideration what the talent dropoff is in later rounds. We can find a receiver in the 2nd or 3rd like Michael Pittman that would be a much more valuable pick than Tee Higgins in the 1st, for example.	0.9606

fo4bn1e	1587501549	Packers	nfl	I still think he stays.  The return they would want and what everyone is willing to give are two different things.  Unless someone gets wowed by an offer, most players arent traded on rookie deals unless they were going to get released anyway.  Rookie deals are very priced very low and OJ Howard is being paid as the 36 TE and he is still giving them a better performance than that salary indicates.	0.761

Never won a SINGLE playoff game in 16 years.Did their ownership suck?  Yeah, but they had some players that couldve gotten things done.  Its not like baseball where ownership can actively destroy your franchise like the Pirates.  In the NFL, theyre all working with the same pool of money, salary cap, etc.  How he survived the first 8 years, only making the playoffs twice is beyond my ability to fathom.  He shouldve never seen the 2010s with that team, let alone being rewarded for mediocrity.	0.734

When I say Asians, I dont mean your Vietnamese, working at nail salon type. I mean South Korean doctors and business owners type.I say that not to be demeaning but to point out a huge fact.Most of the people that live around that area are hispanic and black and the Vietnamese Asians.There are very few South Korean and Indian kids at the middle school and high school in that area.I know. I have family and friends that teach at those schools.So I ask a friend one time how come? Where do these peoples kids go to school?He said they probably go to private schools further away and their parents probably work further away as well.His point was illustrated when I saw a Congrats Grad banner in one yard during a drive. The High School was definitely not the local school.

fo4btnz	1587501639	Seahawks	team	While Singletary looked like an above average running back I disagree with just about every other running back you mentioned. Mattison couldnt beat out Mike Boone when Dalvin Cook got injured, so I have no clue what you were watching. Sanders was nothing special and Pollard did well but also nothing above average. I wasnt comparing Jacobs and Homer, I was just pointing out that good running backs  wins. The problem down the stretch last season wasnt who was carrying the ball, it was that we repeatedly took the ball out of our best players hands and put him in situations where he had to bail us out time and time again.Im not saying that Homer is better than any of those guys, Im saying that having them would it have won us any more games last season.

fo4bux4	1587501656	Patriots	team	I concur. Gronks back, neck and knees are made of prayer and balsa wood and Tampa knows this. Im not slagging Gronk since when healthy, he is still a real weapon for Brady, and defenses will have to adjust in a way that creates favorable matchups across the field, but hes not the same guy he was in NE.And its very unlikely that Tampa (read Brady, because hes calling the shots) wants to give up a valuable second TE option in OJ Howard either. Think of how deadly TB was with Gronk and Hernandez, but now measurably slow both Brady and Gronk down, and you can see Howards prospective importance. Taking away TE tools is NOT peak Brady. My uneducated guess is that Tampa parts with a third round pick and possibly swaps a fifth. And you can bet then on two things BB will package a third or two to go shopping, and that whatever he does bring in, 98 of rPatriots, myself included, will be caught off guard.	0.891

(892.2)I think realistically you guys only have a potential trade partner in Philly before us and if Jefferson, or the big 3 receivers are still available, I cant imagine they trade out given how huge of a need WR is for them. Otherwise comes the gauntlet of NE, NOLA, GB, etc who may be willing to take a shot on Love and let him sit. AKA a trade is going to have to be pretty overwhelmingly in favor of the Vikes (or Eagles).3444 and a future second may be an option too, but definitely at least 2 seconds or conceding. Otherwise fair market point trading youd be looking at 34 or 44  75  122 (825725) and picking just once until pick 160. Rick would love that trade even if the points were lower, but Im not sure how much your roster can sustain a draft being a project QB, a second round pick and a couple picks late into the 3rd day.	0.9539

However, he may be available when we pick near the beginning of the second round, so I included him in that section.Also, many pundits have him with a 1st2nd round grade, indicating that grey area between rounds.

Any qb that could throw a 7 yard pass would have done well in that scenario.The point is that they might not have gone 133. But they would have won 10 games no matter who was qb. And having a better qb in the playoffs is all that mattered considering they went one and done largely to Dak being unable to move the ball against the 30th ranked secondary for an entire half.Do you want a regular season record, or do you want playoff success? Not starting Romo was a mistake and we have the actual results to show it. They lost in the DV. We know it was a mistake.	0.7175

fo4c33n	1587501768	Jets	team	I feel like no one is really talking about this quote. JD said hes going to take the best player available which is the same thing his mentor Ozzie Newsome did. I dont believe he likes all 4 OT. I think he likes maybe 2 or 3 and if all 3 are gone which is a strong possibility, I can see him drafting the best player available which would most like be a WR. Teams that could draft OT before we do Giants  Their GM has already said they plan on protecting D. Jones. Gettleman doesnt smokescreen and drafts what he says he will draft if you look at his history the past two years. Cardinals  They want to protect their young QB and they already have a top WRJags  Theyre a wild card. Not really sure what they plan on doing. They seem to be tanking for next year so they might just address OL. Browns  Theyve made it clear that they want to protect Baker. In this scenario, I could see us trading back or drafting a WR. Ive been on record saying that I like Jeudy more but Ive been watching tape on both him and CeeDee Lamb and Lamb has much better hands. Lamb catches the ball with ease while Jeudy is more of a body catcher. On the other hand, Jeudy is a better route runner. Im so glad Im not a GM because I dont know what Id do in this scenario.	0.9877

Maybe they would take a midround pick (or RB?) to replace the 4th they just traded away?Idk why the Giants would be rushing to trade Engram either unless they just want as many picks as possible in their rebuild, they think Engram is shot physically, andor they want to build around Kaden Smith at TE?	-0.3999

That even includes people who played with Henderson and even outplayed him (Teez Tabor, per the article). Again, if he is Joe Haden, cool.

fo4cdr8	1587501915	Lions	team	I disagree, Id wager a lot of people are getting caught up with his combine performance when the point is that if he is playing at NT to replace Snacks like Id wager he would at least if I were running the team, rushing the passer is his secondary job, namely I just want his to tie up blocks and if he gets free collapse the pocket inside and force to the QB into the loving arms of Flowers and ideally if we trade down Epenesa who basically a better version potentially of Flowers. Then you rotate Epenesa in on third down if you playing a 43 with Brown at NT and Flowers at LDE and thats still great line. Basically I want them to build up the front seven, it would quicken the maturation of the back four or five scheme depending.As far as Simmons, blitz him often and make his athleticism a issue for the opposing OL, I really hope our new DC has taken plenty of notes from Schwartz as far as blitz packages and how to utilize them as Ive grown tired of the same ole rush three and surprised Pikachu face when the QB can proceed to make a five course meal with a clean pocket.Simmons could be a beast in either a 43 at SAM or 34 as a JOKER, he about the same size as Kyle Van Noy coming out of college and Clay Matthews too. The narrative that hes too small doesnt make sense to me, never mind that he could still put on weight and not lose much speed.	0.9707

I think no matter which QB we draft, theres gonna be a lot of red flags for, cause honestly the only QB I like is Burrows. But trading around to take him in a mid round would at least give us a backup QB who deserves a shot in whats is in my  opinion, a weak qb class.

fo4cmm5	1587502036	Patriots	nfl	 TBs 4th was worth 60 points on the Jimmy Johnson draft chart. NEs highest 7th was worth 1 pt.Based on the same chart, 23 overall (where NE picks) is worth 760.

fo4cmmi	1587502036	Jaguars	team	Depends on the cost of moving from the 3rd to a midlate 2nd rounder. If it wont set us back, where we can walk away with an OT, WR, and DB (excluding Dobbins)? I am more open to that. Ideally, my top 2 picks would be Lamb and Thomas. DB, maybe someone like Bryce Hall or the guy from Utah in the 2nd round.

fo4cmsh	1587502039	Patriots	team	He was physically destroyed by the end of the SB run. Needed time to recover physically and mentally, did so for a year. At this point, clearly the pats dont make sense for someone looking for another year or two in the league. He busted his ass and gave us a ton of incredible memories, now hes taking an opportunity to go play with Tom and make another run at it. The pats tried to trade him in his final year.  I cant get angry and gronk at all here. This does nothing to tarnish his legacy with NE. BB runs an extremely effective program but its one that doesnt incentivize most players to stick around towards the end of their career.

fo4cmym	1587502041	Ravens	nfl	Sanders had more interceptions for more yards and more TDs. He also played on offense. And has more recieving touchdowns. He has more career tackles.

You wont find a whole lot, I can tell you that.I look forward to you twisting big contributors to mean whatever fits your delusional argument, but how about Jamie Collins, Logan Ryan, Duron Harmon, Bryan Stork, James White, Trey Flowers, Shaq Mason, Joe Cardona, Joe Thuney, Malcolm Mitchell, Elandon Roberts, Ted Karras, and Sony Michel (yes).

fo4d1bt	1587502242	Patriots	team	Considering the defense was constantly on the field due to Jameis turnovers, I would say they are a solid group.

fo4d1t6	1587502249	49ers	nfl	 and being unable to sell any PSLs in the stadium that youre rentingThats ultimately not his problem. 100 of the revenue from Chargers PSLs was going to the Rams to help pay for the stadium. By not selling PSLs he just shafted Kroenke. This isnt a popular opinion on this sub, but from a business perspective Spanos got a sweetheart deal. He is responsible for 0 in stadium construction, pays 1 a year to lease the facility, and is entitled to a percentage of revenue. Its zero risk, he could move the team later to somewhere else without losing money he invested in this project, and a lot of reward in that hes entitled to some stadium revenue in the 2nd largest US Market.	0.9682

As for Geathers, he was benched for Willis shortly after this game if I recall correctly.Was it one play? Sure. But it was a crushing play, and its specifically the kind of play that Cover 2 is designed to prevent.

His WRs were not getting any separation and he was still very efficient and no matter how you view him, hes still an upgrade over Jameis.  Bruce Arians is also one of the best HC in the league rn.  As for Gronk, hes only been out for a year and his last game, he had the game changing catch that won them the Superbowl.  They still have a chemistry together.  Hes not gonna be the same gronk, but hes also behind OJ Howard as well.  Currently, Id see us trading wins at this point but the draft is what really matters.	0.9369

Because its been so incredibly frustrating being on it and having an opinion thats anything short of Trubisky being the second coming. Seriously, he could continue to be just as terrible for the next decade and every year itd be the same litany of excuses... His first year doesnt count, and he only had one year in college, so really this is only his Xth season, and he didnt have an OL or weapons, and its a really complex system, and Nagy doesnt play to his strengths, and did you see his game against the Bucs?

fo4dc0l	1587502390	Redskins	team	 The Redskins made the genius decision to draft a QB with your first round pick in 2019 then fire the coach halfway through the season! Now leaving your Franchise QB without the coach who drafted him Most reports suggest Gruden didnt want Haskins, which is why he was reluctant to play him (not just because he was newrawundeveloped). Haskins and his role were merely the demonstration of the different mindsets of Gruden and the front office. Gruden wasnt the guy who drafted him, according to most.Ron Rivera has a reputation for being an aggressive offensive playcaller (Riverboat Ron, for his gambling style), and anyone who was hired would definitely make some changes to the offenses approach for the 16 ppg reason you mentioned.	-0.672

Ideally to me it is trading back 43 (grabbing a late 2nd and a 3rd), using 50 on either Diggs, Terrell (Hes my CB2 and I think hes gone really early but still) or Arnette and in the late 2nd grabbing Hamler (if hes still there) or a safety and using the 3rd on someone like Hunt, Muti or Bredeson	0.9797

No I took the 6 games where Alabama didnt out talent everyone on the other team. When Tua faced competition that was in equal in talent to Alabama he was at best mediocre.

fo4djzg	1587502499	Jets	team	I agree 100 and this is the take a lot of this sub needs to hear. Just because theres a big 4 of OTs doesnt mean were high on all 4 of them, every team is going to have their favorite(s), and others they arent as high on. I would also add the Chargers into the mix for an OT round 1 depending on how their QB rankings are and if they can get their guy, which further complicates things in front of us. Will all 5 of those teams go Oline? No, but there is a possibility the guys we do love are gone by then, and if Im an NFL GM, if I dont love my 4 OT thats sitting there, Im not risking it by reaching on him for the sole purpose of taking an OT. Hopefully one of our guys is there, but you cant go into the draft with tunnel vision and just assume everything is going to go your way, especially when youre out of the top 10.	0.9312

Watch the whole of last season again, when we were 70 Brady looked like the qb of a team that 34. Granted he still one of the better qbs in the NFL he isnt the same Brady, who need I remind you, doesnt like rookies.

Day 2 is fundamental to good football teams. (Seattle has made a living being great at Day 2). Unfortunately neither of his 2 drafts since hes been back have been able to inspire any confidence so far since the return of Hurney our day 2 picks have beenGreg LittleWill GrierDonte JacksonRashaan Gaulden.

fo4domr	1587502563	Texans	team	You keep saying Im apologizing for Bob.  Please point where?  You think Clowney has value but the fact he is still a FA should prove to you that no one wanted him.  We actually got way better end of that deal than the Seahawks.  They gave us a 3rd a 5th and 2 players for a 1 year rental on an injured Clowney.  No one wanted him you cant trade a guy for a 1st round pick that people wont even pickup in FA.  You living in a fairy land world where you think people have value that dont.  And if you even mention the Hopkins trade Ill just point you back up to where I said it was terrible.  Bob did good things for this organization and turned us into a playoff team.  I dont think he can turn us into a SB team.  As Ive already said.  If you cant see BoB did that then you started watching the Texans in 2010 and only know us as a team thats been to the playoffs.  I started on 2002 and we lost for a fucking decade before Kubiak got us 2 playoff appearances.  Then he went 214 and thats the team Bob got with no QB.  So yes sorry I think Bob built us up a bit from a 214 team to a team that has made playoffs every year. And just FYI you part of the asshole problem as well.	-0.7452

Hopefully, we will get to play that fuck this season. I harbor no ill will against the Buccs as an organization. But the fact that Brady got his favorite toy back and it went so seamlessly. Just once, I want somebody to fleece Belicheat.No more fucking woe is me, my back hurts, oh, I get hammered everytime I have the ball and the refs look the other way bullshit from Gronk and his fans.

fo4dz2t	1587502705	Eagles	team	And Im not saying that we shouldnt upgrade at the slot position. Im saying that its an easier need to fill. On top of that, Agholors success was dependent on having two other outside WRs demanding attention and freeing up the areas in which he and Ertz normally worked. Jefferson will be working the same area with another mouth to feed.The other consideration is that its not a certainty that hes going to be a stud in the slot. No player is guaranteed to be a slam dunk and, while I can understand going for the best player available there, overlooking his fit when we have two great TEs for two more years would be foolish. Also, why would we be taking an outside WR later? If were not taking Jefferson at WR, theres still a very real chance we still take a WR that fits the mold of an outside WR.As for your slot comparison, most of the slot WRs that youre talking about (save Thielen and Kupp) found success on the outside before moving into the slot and played almost entirely in that position in college and were projected as outside WR. Adams, Allen, Thomas, Hopkins all found success on the outside in college and then in the NFL. Jefferson still didnt do all that well in college on the outside and serious had issues with press coverage. He didnt face it often, but he handled it poorly when there.	0.9368

fo4e1kg	1587502740	Lions	team	To be sure, I certainly think Okudah could help the Lions (a fart could help the Lions). I just think help along the line and pass rush are needed more and will also help the secondary (Simmons will help both the secondary and pass rush).  Not too keen on taking Brown at 3 either but would prefer over Okudah (Brown will be more than just a run stuffer). Would have no problem taking Simmons at 3. Hopefully they trade back, get a few extra picks and still get one of the three. Its a crap shoot. You never know. Undrafted players can have goodgreat careers and first rounders can amount to nothing. Okudah should not be the pick at 3 is my opinion and Im sticking to it. If they take him at 3, I hope you can bring this up in a few years and laugh at me for how wrong I was. Hell, maybe theyll take a TE!?	0.6677

fo4e5y9	1587502800	Ravens	nfl	So a player can retire but they are still under contract. The reason for this is that it prevent players from retiring from one team and then just joining another. Its a preventative measure to make sure players dont abuse the system. And just incase the player decides they want to come back, it gives them an instant in back into the league. At any point the team can trade that contract, as long as the player involved agrees to it. Even if he doesnt play. Its an interesting situation but I understand why it exist.	0.9062
